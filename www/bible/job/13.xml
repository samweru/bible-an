      <v n="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all {this}, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</v>
      <v n="2">What ye know, {the same} do I know also: I {am} not inferior unto you.</v>
      <v n="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</v>
      <v n="4">But ye {are} forgers of lies, ye {are} all physicians of no value.</v>
      <v n="5">O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</v>
      <v n="6">Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</v>
      <v n="7">Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</v>
      <v n="8">Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</v>
      <v n="9">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye {so} mock him?</v>
      <v n="10">He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</v>
      <v n="11">Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</v>
      <v n="12">Your remembrances {are} like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</v>
      <v n="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what {will}. {Hold...: Heb. Be silent from me}</v>
      <v n="14">Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</v>
      <v n="15">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. {maintain: Heb. prove, or, argue}</v>
      <v n="16">He also {shall be} my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</v>
      <v n="17">Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</v>
      <v n="18">Behold now, I have ordered {my} cause; I know that I shall be justified.</v>
      <v n="19">Who {is} he {that} will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</v>
      <v n="20">Only do not two {things} unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</v>
      <v n="21">Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</v>
      <v n="22">Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</v>
      <v n="23">How many {are} mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</v>
      <v n="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</v>
      <v n="25">Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</v>
      <v n="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</v>
      <v n="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. {lookest...: Heb. observest} {heels: Heb. roots}</v>
      <v n="28">And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</v>
