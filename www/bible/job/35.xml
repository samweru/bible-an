      <v n="1">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, {that} thou saidst, My righteousness {is} more than God's?</v>
      <v n="3">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? {and}, What profit shall I have, {if I be cleansed} from my sin? {if...: or, by it more than by my sin}</v>
      <v n="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. {answer...: Heb. return to thee words}</v>
      <v n="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds {which} are higher than thou.</v>
      <v n="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or {if} thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</v>
      <v n="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</v>
      <v n="8">Thy wickedness {may hurt} a man as thou {art}; and thy righteousness {may profit} the son of man.</v>
      <v n="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make {the oppressed} to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</v>
      <v n="10">But none saith, Where {is} God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</v>
      <v n="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</v>
      <v n="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</v>
      <v n="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</v>
      <v n="14">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, {yet} judgment {is} before him; therefore trust thou in him.</v>
      <v n="15">But now, because {it is} not {so}, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth {it} not in great extremity: {he hath: that is, God hath} {he knoweth: that is, Job knoweth}</v>
      <v n="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</v>
    </c>
