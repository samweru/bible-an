      <v n="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? {as he...: or, if he may be profitable, doth his good success depend thereon?}</v>
      <v n="3">{Is it} any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or {is it} gain {to him}, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</v>
      <v n="4">Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</v>
      <v n="5">{Is} not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</v>
      <v n="6">For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing. {the naked...: Heb. the clothes of the naked}</v>
      <v n="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</v>
      <v n="8">But {as for} the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. {mighty...: Heb. man of arm} {honourable...: Heb. eminent, or, accepted for countenance}</v>
      <v n="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</v>
      <v n="10">Therefore snares {are} round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</v>
      <v n="11">Or darkness, {that} thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</v>
      <v n="12">{Is} not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! {height of the stars: Heb. head of the stars}</v>
      <v n="13">And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? {How: or, What}</v>
      <v n="14">Thick clouds {are} a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</v>
      <v n="15">Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</v>
      <v n="16">Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood: {whose...: Heb. a flood was poured upon their foundation}</v>
      <v n="17">Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? {for: or, to}</v>
      <v n="18">Yet he filled their houses with good {things}: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</v>
      <v n="19">The righteous see {it}, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</v>
      <v n="20">Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. {substance: or, estate} {the remnant...: or, their excellency}</v>
      <v n="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee. {him: that is, God}</v>
      <v n="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</v>
      <v n="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</v>
      <v n="24">Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the {gold} of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. {as dust: or, on the dust}</v>
      <v n="25">Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. {defence: or, gold} {plenty...: Heb. silver of strength}</v>
      <v n="26">For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</v>
      <v n="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</v>
      <v n="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</v>
      <v n="29">When {men} are cast down, then thou shalt say, {There is} lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. {the humble...: Heb. him that hath low eyes}</v>
      <v n="30">He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands. {He shall...: or, The innocent shall deliver the island}</v>
