      <v n="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct {him}? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</v>
      <v n="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</v>
      <v n="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</v>
      <v n="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</v>
      <v n="6">Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</v>
      <v n="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</v>
      <v n="8">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</v>
      <v n="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</v>
      <v n="10">Deck thyself now {with} majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</v>
      <v n="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one {that is} proud, and abase him.</v>
      <v n="12">Look on every one {that is} proud, {and} bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</v>
      <v n="13">Hide them in the dust together; {and} bind their faces in secret.</v>
      <v n="14">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</v>
      <v n="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. {behemoth: probably an extinct animal of some kind}</v>
      <v n="16">Lo now, his strength {is} in his loins, and his force {is} in the navel of his belly.</v>
      <v n="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. {He...: or, He setteth up}</v>
      <v n="18">His bones {are as} strong pieces of brass; his bones {are} like bars of iron.</v>
      <v n="19">He {is} the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach {unto him}.</v>
      <v n="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</v>
      <v n="21">He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</v>
      <v n="22">The shady trees cover him {with} their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</v>
      <v n="23">Behold, he drinketh up a river, {and} hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. {he drinketh up: Heb. he oppresseth}</v>
      <v n="24">He taketh it with his eyes: {his} nose pierceth through snares. {He...: or, Will any take him in his sight, or, bore his nose with a gin?}</v>
