      <v n="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Who {is} this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</v>
      <v n="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. {answer...: Heb. make me know}</v>
      <v n="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. {hast...: Heb. knowest understanding}</v>
      <v n="5">Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</v>
      <v n="6">Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; {foundations: Heb. sockets} {fastened: Heb. made to sink?}</v>
      <v n="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</v>
      <v n="8">Or {who} shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, {as if} it had issued out of the womb?</v>
      <v n="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</v>
      <v n="10">And brake up for it my decreed {place}, and set bars and doors, {brake...: or, established my decree upon it}</v>
      <v n="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed? {thy...: Heb. the pride of thy waves}</v>
      <v n="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; {and} caused the dayspring to know his place;</v>
      <v n="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? {ends: Heb. wings}</v>
      <v n="14">It is turned as clay {to} the seal; and they stand as a garment.</v>
      <v n="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</v>
      <v n="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</v>
      <v n="17">Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</v>
      <v n="18">Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</v>
      <v n="19">Where {is} the way {where} light dwelleth? and {as for} darkness, where {is} the place thereof,</v>
      <v n="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths {to} the house thereof? {to the bound: or, at, etc}</v>
      <v n="21">Knowest thou {it}, because thou wast then born? or {because} the number of thy days {is} great?</v>
      <v n="22">Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</v>
      <v n="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</v>
      <v n="24">By what way is the light parted, {which} scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</v>
      <v n="25">Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</v>
      <v n="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, {where} no man {is; on} the wilderness, wherein {there is} no man;</v>
      <v n="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste {ground}; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</v>
      <v n="28">Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</v>
      <v n="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</v>
      <v n="30">The waters are hid as {with} a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. {is...: Heb. is taken}</v>
      <v n="31">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? {Pleiades: or, the seven stars: Heb. Cimah} {Orion: Heb. Cesil?}</v>
      <v n="32">Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? {Mazzaroth: or, the twelve signs} {guide: Heb. guide them}</v>
      <v n="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</v>
      <v n="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</v>
      <v n="35">Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we {are}? {Here...: Heb. Behold us?}</v>
      <v n="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</v>
      <v n="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven, {stay: Heb. cause to lie down}</v>
      <v n="38">When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together? {groweth...: or, is turned into mire: Heb. is poured}</v>
      <v n="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, {the appetite: Heb. the life}</v>
      <v n="40">When they couch in {their} dens, {and} abide in the covert to lie in wait?</v>
      <v n="41">Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</v>
