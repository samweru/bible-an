      <v n="1">But Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">How hast thou helped {him that is} without power? {how} savest thou the arm {that hath} no strength?</v>
      <v n="3">How hast thou counselled {him that hath} no wisdom? and {how} hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</v>
      <v n="4">To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</v>
      <v n="5">Dead {things} are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. {and the...: or, with the inhabitants}</v>
      <v n="6">Hell {is} naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</v>
      <v n="7">He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, {and} hangeth the earth upon nothing.</v>
      <v n="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</v>
      <v n="9">He holdeth back the face of his throne, {and} spreadeth his cloud upon it.</v>
      <v n="10">He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. {until...: Heb. until the end of light with darkness}</v>
      <v n="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</v>
      <v n="12">He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. {the proud: Heb. pride}</v>
      <v n="13">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</v>
      <v n="14">Lo, these {are} parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</v>
