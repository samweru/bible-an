      <v n="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, {continued: Heb. added to take up}</v>
      <v n="2">{As} God liveth, {who} hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, {who} hath vexed my soul; {vexed...: Heb. made my soul bitter}</v>
      <v n="3">All the while my breath {is} in me, and the spirit of God {is} in my nostrils; {the spirit...: that is, the breath which God gave him}</v>
      <v n="4">My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</v>
      <v n="5">God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</v>
      <v n="6">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach {me} so long as I live. {so long...: Heb. from my days}</v>
      <v n="7">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</v>
      <v n="8">For what {is} the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</v>
      <v n="9">Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</v>
      <v n="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?</v>
      <v n="11">I will teach you by the hand of God: {that} which {is} with the Almighty will I not conceal. {by...: or, being in the hand, etc}</v>
      <v n="12">Behold, all ye yourselves have seen {it}; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</v>
      <v n="13">This {is} the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, {which} they shall receive of the Almighty.</v>
      <v n="14">If his children be multiplied, {it is} for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</v>
      <v n="15">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</v>
      <v n="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</v>
      <v n="17">He may prepare {it}, but the just shall put {it} on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</v>
      <v n="18">He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth {that} the keeper maketh.</v>
      <v n="19">The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he {is} not.</v>
      <v n="20">Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</v>
      <v n="21">The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</v>
      <v n="22">For {God} shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand. {he...: Heb. in fleeing he would flee}</v>
      <v n="23">{Men} shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</v>
