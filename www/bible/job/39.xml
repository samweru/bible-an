      <v n="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? {or} canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</v>
      <v n="2">Canst thou number the months {that} they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</v>
      <v n="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</v>
      <v n="4">Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</v>
      <v n="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</v>
      <v n="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings. {barren...: Heb. salt places}</v>
      <v n="7">He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. {of the driver: Heb. of the exactor}</v>
      <v n="8">The range of the mountains {is} his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</v>
      <v n="9">Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</v>
      <v n="10">Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</v>
      <v n="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength {is} great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</v>
      <v n="12">Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather {it into} thy barn?</v>
      <v n="13">{Gavest thou} the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? {wings and...: or, the feathers of the stork and ostrich}</v>
      <v n="14">Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</v>
      <v n="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</v>
      <v n="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though {they were} not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</v>
      <v n="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</v>
      <v n="18">What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</v>
      <v n="19">Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</v>
      <v n="20">Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils {is} terrible. {terrible: Heb. terror}</v>
      <v n="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in {his} strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men. {He paweth: or, His feet dig} {the armed...: Heb. the armour}</v>
      <v n="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</v>
      <v n="23">The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</v>
      <v n="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that {it is} the sound of the trumpet.</v>
      <v n="25">He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</v>
      <v n="26">Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, {and} stretch her wings toward the south?</v>
      <v n="27">Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? {at...: Heb. by thy mouth}</v>
      <v n="28">She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</v>
      <v n="29">From thence she seeketh the prey, {and} her eyes behold afar off.</v>
      <v n="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain {are}, there {is} she.</v>
