      <v n="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">How long wilt thou speak these {things}? and {how long shall} the words of thy mouth {be like} a strong wind?</v>
      <v n="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</v>
      <v n="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression; {for...: Heb. in the hand of their transgression}</v>
      <v n="5">If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</v>
      <v n="6">If thou {wert} pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</v>
      <v n="7">Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</v>
      <v n="8">For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</v>
      <v n="9">(For we {are but of} yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth {are} a shadow:) {nothing: Heb. not}</v>
      <v n="10">Shall not they teach thee, {and} tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</v>
      <v n="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</v>
      <v n="12">Whilst it {is} yet in his greenness, {and} not cut down, it withereth before any {other} herb.</v>
      <v n="13">So {are} the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</v>
      <v n="14">Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust {shall be} a spider's web. {web: Heb. house}</v>
      <v n="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</v>
      <v n="16">He {is} green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</v>
      <v n="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, {and} seeth the place of stones.</v>
      <v n="18">If he destroy him from his place, then {it} shall deny him, {saying}, I have not seen thee.</v>
      <v n="19">Behold, this {is} the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</v>
      <v n="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect {man}, neither will he help the evil doers: {help...: Heb. take the ungodly by the hand} {come: Heb. shall not be}</v>
      <v n="21">Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. {rejoicing: Heb. shouting for joy}</v>
      <v n="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought. {shall come...: Heb. shall not be}</v>
