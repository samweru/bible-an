      <v n="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">How long {will it be ere} ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</v>
      <v n="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, {and} reputed vile in your sight?</v>
      <v n="4">He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place? {himself: Heb. his soul}</v>
      <v n="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</v>
      <v n="6">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him. {candle: or, lamp}</v>
      <v n="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</v>
      <v n="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</v>
      <v n="9">The gin shall take {him} by the heel, {and} the robber shall prevail against him.</v>
      <v n="10">The snare {is} laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. {laid: Heb. hidden}</v>
      <v n="11">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. {drive: Heb. scatter}</v>
      <v n="12">His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction {shall be} ready at his side.</v>
      <v n="13">It shall devour the strength of his skin: {even} the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. {strength: Heb. bars}</v>
      <v n="14">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</v>
      <v n="15">It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because {it is} none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</v>
      <v n="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</v>
      <v n="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</v>
      <v n="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world. {He...: Heb. They shall drive him}</v>
      <v n="19">He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</v>
      <v n="20">They that come after {him} shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted. {went...: or, lived with him} {were...: Heb. laid hold on horror}</v>
      <v n="21">Surely such {are} the dwellings of the wicked, and this {is} the place {of him that} knoweth not God.</v>
