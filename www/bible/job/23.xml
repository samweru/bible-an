      <v n="1">Then Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Even to day {is} my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. {stroke: Heb. hand}</v>
      <v n="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! {that} I might come {even} to his seat!</v>
      <v n="4">I would order {my} cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</v>
      <v n="5">I would know the words {which} he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</v>
      <v n="6">Will he plead against me with {his} great power? No; but he would put {strength} in me.</v>
      <v n="7">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</v>
      <v n="8">Behold, I go forward, but he {is} not {there}; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</v>
      <v n="9">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold {him}: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see {him}:</v>
      <v n="10">But he knoweth the way that I take: {when} he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. {that...: Heb. that is with me}</v>
      <v n="11">My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</v>
      <v n="12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary {food}. {esteemed: Heb. hid, or, laid up} {my...: or, my appointed portion}</v>
      <v n="13">But he {is} in one {mind}, and who can turn him? and {what} his soul desireth, even {that} he doeth.</v>
      <v n="14">For he performeth {the thing that is} appointed for me: and many such {things are} with him.</v>
      <v n="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</v>
      <v n="16">For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</v>
      <v n="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, {neither} hath he covered the darkness from my face.</v>
