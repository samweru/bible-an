      <v n="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Hear my words, O ye wise {men}; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</v>
      <v n="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. {mouth: Heb. palate}</v>
      <v n="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what {is} good.</v>
      <v n="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</v>
      <v n="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound {is} incurable without transgression. {my wound: Heb. mine arrow}</v>
      <v n="7">What man {is} like Job, {who} drinketh up scorning like water?</v>
      <v n="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</v>
      <v n="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</v>
      <v n="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, {that he should do} wickedness; and {from} the Almighty, {that he should commit} iniquity. {men...: Heb. men of heart}</v>
      <v n="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to {his} ways.</v>
      <v n="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</v>
      <v n="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? {the whole: Heb. all of it?}</v>
      <v n="14">If he set his heart upon man, {if} he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; {man: Heb. him}</v>
      <v n="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</v>
      <v n="16">If now {thou hast} understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</v>
      <v n="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? {govern: Heb. bind?}</v>
      <v n="18">{Is it fit} to say to a king, {Thou art} wicked? {and} to princes, {Ye are} ungodly?</v>
      <v n="19">{How much less to him} that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all {are} the work of his hands.</v>
      <v n="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. {the mighty...: Heb. they shall take away the mighty}</v>
      <v n="21">For his eyes {are} upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</v>
      <v n="22">{There is} no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</v>
      <v n="23">For he will not lay upon man more {than right}; that he should enter into judgment with God. {enter: Heb. go}</v>
      <v n="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. {number: Heb. searching out}</v>
      <v n="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth {them} in the night, so that they are destroyed. {destroyed: Heb. crushed}</v>
      <v n="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; {open...: Heb. place of beholders}</v>
      <v n="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: {him: Heb. after him}</v>
      <v n="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</v>
      <v n="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth {his} face, who then can behold him? whether {it be done} against a nation, or against a man only:</v>
      <v n="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</v>
      <v n="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne {chastisement}, I will not offend {any more}:</v>
      <v n="32">{That which} I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</v>
      <v n="33">{Should it be} according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. {according...: Heb. from with thee?}</v>
      <v n="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. {of...: Heb. of heart}</v>
      <v n="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words {were} without wisdom.</v>
      <v n="36">My desire {is that} Job may be tried unto the end because of {his} answers for wicked men. {My...: or, My father, let Job be tried}</v>
      <v n="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth {his hands} among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</v>
