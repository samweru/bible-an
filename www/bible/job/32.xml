      <v n="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he {was} righteous in his own eyes. {to...: Heb. from answering}</v>
      <v n="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. {himself: Heb. his soul}</v>
      <v n="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and {yet} had condemned Job.</v>
      <v n="4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they {were} elder than he. {waited...: Heb. expected Job in words} {elder: Heb. elder for days}</v>
      <v n="5">When Elihu saw that {there was} no answer in the mouth of {these} three men, then his wrath was kindled.</v>
      <v n="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I {am} young, and ye {are} very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. {young: Heb. few of days} {durst...: Heb. feared}</v>
      <v n="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</v>
      <v n="8">But {there is} a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</v>
      <v n="9">Great men are not {always} wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</v>
      <v n="10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</v>
      <v n="11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. {reasons: Heb. understandings} {what...: Heb. words}</v>
      <v n="12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, {there was} none of you that convinced Job, {or} that answered his words:</v>
      <v n="13">Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</v>
      <v n="14">Now he hath not directed {his} words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches. {directed: or, ordered}</v>
      <v n="15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. {left...: Heb. removed speeches from themselves}</v>
      <v n="16">When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, {and} answered no more;)</v>
      <v n="17">{I said}, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</v>
      <v n="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. {matter: Heb. words} {spirit...: Heb. spirit of my belly}</v>
      <v n="19">Behold, my belly {is} as wine {which} hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. {hath...: Heb. is not opened}</v>
      <v n="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. {be...: Heb. breathe}</v>
      <v n="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</v>
      <v n="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; {in so doing} my maker would soon take me away.</v>
