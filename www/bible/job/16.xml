      <v n="1">Then Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters {are} ye all. {miserable: or, troublesome}</v>
      <v n="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest? {vain...: Heb. words of wind}</v>
      <v n="4">I also could speak as ye {do}: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</v>
      <v n="5">{But} I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage {your grief}.</v>
      <v n="6">Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and {though} I forbear, what am I eased? {what...: Heb. what goeth from me?}</v>
      <v n="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</v>
      <v n="8">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, {which} is a witness {against me}: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</v>
      <v n="9">He teareth {me} in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</v>
      <v n="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</v>
      <v n="11">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. {hath...: Heb. hath shut me up}</v>
      <v n="12">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken {me} by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</v>
      <v n="13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</v>
      <v n="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</v>
      <v n="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</v>
      <v n="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids {is} the shadow of death;</v>
      <v n="17">Not for {any} injustice in mine hands: also my prayer {is} pure.</v>
      <v n="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</v>
      <v n="19">Also now, behold, my witness {is} in heaven, and my record {is} on high. {on high: Heb. in the high places}</v>
      <v n="20">My friends scorn me: {but} mine eye poureth out {tears} unto God. {scorn me: Heb. are my scorners}</v>
      <v n="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man {pleadeth} for his neighbour! {neighbour: or, friend}</v>
      <v n="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way {whence} I shall not return. {a few...: Heb. years of number}</v>
