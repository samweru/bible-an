      <v n="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for {this} I make haste. {I make...: Heb. my haste is in me}</v>
      <v n="3">I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</v>
      <v n="4">Knowest thou {not} this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</v>
      <v n="5">That the triumphing of the wicked {is} short, and the joy of the hypocrite {but} for a moment? {short: Heb. from near}</v>
      <v n="6">Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; {clouds: Heb. cloud}</v>
      <v n="7">{Yet} he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where {is} he?</v>
      <v n="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</v>
      <v n="9">The eye also {which} saw him shall {see him} no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</v>
      <v n="10">His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods. {His children...: or, The poor shall oppress his children}</v>
      <v n="11">His bones are full {of the sin} of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</v>
      <v n="12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, {though} he hide it under his tongue;</v>
      <v n="13">{Though} he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth: {within...: Heb. in the midst of his palate}</v>
      <v n="14">{Yet} his meat in his bowels is turned, {it is} the gall of asps within him.</v>
      <v n="15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</v>
      <v n="16">He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</v>
      <v n="17">He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter. {the floods...: or, streaming brooks}</v>
      <v n="18">That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow {it} down: according to {his} substance {shall} the restitution {be}, and he shall not rejoice {therein}. {his...: Heb. the substance of his exchange}</v>
      <v n="19">Because he hath oppressed {and} hath forsaken the poor; {because} he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; {oppressed: Heb. crushed}</v>
      <v n="20">Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired. {feel: Heb. know}</v>
      <v n="21">There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods. {none...: or, be none left for his meat}</v>
      <v n="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him. {wicked: or, troublesome}</v>
      <v n="23">{When} he is about to fill his belly, {God} shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain {it} upon him while he is eating.</v>
      <v n="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon, {and} the bow of steel shall strike him through.</v>
      <v n="25">It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors {are} upon him.</v>
      <v n="26">All darkness {shall be} hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</v>
      <v n="27">The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</v>
      <v n="28">The increase of his house shall depart, {and his goods} shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</v>
      <v n="29">This {is} the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God. {appointed...: Heb. of his decree from God}</v>
