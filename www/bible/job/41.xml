      <v n="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord {which} thou lettest down? {leviathan: probably an extinct animal of some kind} {which...: Heb. which thou drownest?}</v>
      <v n="2">Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</v>
      <v n="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft {words} unto thee?</v>
      <v n="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</v>
      <v n="5">Wilt thou play with him as {with} a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</v>
      <v n="6">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</v>
      <v n="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</v>
      <v n="8">Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</v>
      <v n="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not {one} be cast down even at the sight of him?</v>
      <v n="10">None {is so} fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</v>
      <v n="11">Who hath prevented me, that I should repay {him? whatsoever is} under the whole heaven is mine.</v>
      <v n="12">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</v>
      <v n="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? {or} who can come {to him} with his double bridle? {with: or, within}</v>
      <v n="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth {are} terrible round about.</v>
      <v n="15">{His} scales {are his} pride, shut up together {as with} a close seal. {scales: Heb. strong pieces of shields}</v>
      <v n="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</v>
      <v n="17">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</v>
      <v n="18">By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes {are} like the eyelids of the morning.</v>
      <v n="19">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, {and} sparks of fire leap out.</v>
      <v n="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as {out} of a seething pot or caldron.</v>
      <v n="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</v>
      <v n="22">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. {is turned into joy: Heb. rejoiceth}</v>
      <v n="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved. {flakes: Heb. fallings}</v>
      <v n="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether {millstone}.</v>
      <v n="25">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</v>
      <v n="26">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. {habergeon: or, breastplate}</v>
      <v n="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, {and} brass as rotten wood.</v>
      <v n="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</v>
      <v n="29">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</v>
      <v n="30">Sharp stones {are} under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. {Sharp stones: Heb. Sharp pieces of potsherd}</v>
      <v n="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</v>
      <v n="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; {one} would think the deep {to be} hoary.</v>
      <v n="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. {is made without fear: or, behave themselves without fear}</v>
      <v n="34">He beholdeth all high {things}: he {is} a king over all the children of pride.</v>
