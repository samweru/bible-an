      <v n="1">And Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">No doubt but ye {are} the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</v>
      <v n="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I {am} not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? {understanding: Heb. an heart} {I am...: Heb. I fall not lower than you} {who...: Heb. with whom are not such as these?}</v>
      <v n="4">I am {as} one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright {man is} laughed to scorn.</v>
      <v n="5">He that is ready to slip with {his} feet {is as} a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</v>
      <v n="6">The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth {abundantly}.</v>
      <v n="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</v>
      <v n="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</v>
      <v n="9">Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</v>
      <v n="10">In whose hand {is} the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. {soul: or, life} {all...: Heb. all flesh of man}</v>
      <v n="11">Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? {mouth: Heb. palate}</v>
      <v n="12">With the ancient {is} wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</v>
      <v n="13">With him {is} wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. {With...: that is, With God}</v>
      <v n="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening. {up: Heb. upon}</v>
      <v n="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</v>
      <v n="16">With him {is} strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver {are} his.</v>
      <v n="17">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</v>
      <v n="18">He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</v>
      <v n="19">He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</v>
      <v n="20">He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. {speech...: Heb. lip of the faithful}</v>
      <v n="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. {weakeneth...: or, looseth the girdle of the strong}</v>
      <v n="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</v>
      <v n="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them {again}. {straiteneth: Heb. leadeth in}</v>
      <v n="24">He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness {where there is} no way.</v>
      <v n="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like {a} drunken {man}. {stagger: Heb. wander}</v>
