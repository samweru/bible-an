      <v n="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that {I have} yet to speak on God's behalf. {I have...: Heb. there are yet words for God}</v>
      <v n="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</v>
      <v n="4">For truly my words {shall} not {be} false: he that is perfect in knowledge {is} with thee.</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, God {is} mighty, and despiseth not {any: he is} mighty in strength {and} wisdom. {wisdom: Heb. heart}</v>
      <v n="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. {poor: or, afflicted}</v>
      <v n="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings {are they} on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</v>
      <v n="8">And if {they be} bound in fetters, {and} be holden in cords of affliction;</v>
      <v n="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</v>
      <v n="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</v>
      <v n="11">If they obey and serve {him}, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</v>
      <v n="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge. {perish: Heb. pass away}</v>
      <v n="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</v>
      <v n="14">They die in youth, and their life {is} among the unclean. {They...: Heb. Their soul dieth} {unclean: or, sodomites}</v>
      <v n="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression. {poor: or, afflicted}</v>
      <v n="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait {into} a broad place, where {there is} no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table {should be} full of fatness. {that...: Heb. the rest of thy table}</v>
      <v n="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold {on thee}. {take...: or, should uphold thee}</v>
      <v n="18">Because {there is} wrath, {beware} lest he take thee away with {his} stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. {deliver...: Heb. turn thee aside}</v>
      <v n="19">Will he esteem thy riches? {no}, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</v>
      <v n="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</v>
      <v n="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</v>
      <v n="22">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</v>
      <v n="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</v>
      <v n="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</v>
      <v n="25">Every man may see it; man may behold {it} afar off.</v>
      <v n="26">Behold, God {is} great, and we know {him} not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</v>
      <v n="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</v>
      <v n="28">Which the clouds do drop {and} distil upon man abundantly.</v>
      <v n="29">Also can {any} understand the spreadings of the clouds, {or} the noise of his tabernacle?</v>
      <v n="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. {bottom: Heb. roots}</v>
      <v n="31">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</v>
      <v n="32">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it {not to shine} by {the cloud} that cometh betwixt.</v>
      <v n="33">The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour. {the vapour: Heb. that which goeth up}</v>
