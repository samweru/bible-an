      <v n="1">But Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! {laid: Heb. lifted up}</v>
      <v n="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. {my words...: that is, I want words to express my grief}</v>
      <v n="4">For the arrows of the Almighty {are} within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</v>
      <v n="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder? {when he...: Heb. at grass?}</v>
      <v n="6">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there {any} taste in the white of an egg?</v>
      <v n="7">The things {that} my soul refused to touch {are} as my sorrowful meat.</v>
      <v n="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant {me} the thing that I long for! {the thing...: Heb. my expectation}</v>
      <v n="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</v>
      <v n="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</v>
      <v n="11">What {is} my strength, that I should hope? and what {is} mine end, that I should prolong my life?</v>
      <v n="12">{Is} my strength the strength of stones? or {is} my flesh of brass? {of brass: Heb. brasen?}</v>
      <v n="13">{Is} not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</v>
      <v n="14">To him that is afflicted pity {should be shewed} from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. {is afflicted: Heb. melteth}</v>
      <v n="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, {and} as the stream of brooks they pass away;</v>
      <v n="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, {and} wherein the snow is hid:</v>
      <v n="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. {vanish: Heb. are cut off} {when...: Heb. in the heat thereof} {consumed: Heb. extinguished}</v>
      <v n="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</v>
      <v n="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</v>
      <v n="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</v>
      <v n="21">For now ye are nothing; ye see {my} casting down, and are afraid. {ye are...: or, ye are like to them: Heb. to it} {nothing: Heb. not}</v>
      <v n="22">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</v>
      <v n="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</v>
      <v n="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</v>
      <v n="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</v>
      <v n="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, {which are} as wind?</v>
      <v n="27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig {a pit} for your friend. {ye overwhelm: Heb. ye cause to fall upon}</v>
      <v n="28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for {it is} evident unto you if I lie. {evident...: Heb. before your face}</v>
      <v n="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness {is} in it. {in it: that is, in this matter}</v>
      <v n="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things? {my taste: Heb. my palate}</v>
