      <v n="1">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</v>
      <v n="2">{Some} remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed {thereof}. {feed...: or, feed them}</v>
      <v n="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</v>
      <v n="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, {as} wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness {yieldeth} food for them {and} for {their} children.</v>
      <v n="6">They reap {every one} his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. {corn: Heb. mingled corn, or, dredge} {they gather...: Heb. the wicked gather the vintage}</v>
      <v n="7">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that {they have} no covering in the cold.</v>
      <v n="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</v>
      <v n="9">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</v>
      <v n="10">They cause {him} to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf {from} the hungry;</v>
      <v n="11">{Which} make oil within their walls, {and} tread {their} winepresses, and suffer thirst.</v>
      <v n="12">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly {to them}.</v>
      <v n="13">They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</v>
      <v n="14">The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</v>
      <v n="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth {his} face. {disguiseth...: Heb. setteth his face in secret}</v>
      <v n="16">In the dark they dig through houses, {which} they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</v>
      <v n="17">For the morning {is} to them even as the shadow of death: if {one} know {them, they are in} the terrors of the shadow of death.</v>
      <v n="18">He {is} swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</v>
      <v n="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: {so doth} the grave {those which} have sinned. {consume: Heb. violently take}</v>
      <v n="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</v>
      <v n="21">He evil entreateth the barren {that} beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</v>
      <v n="22">He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no {man} is sure of life. {no...: or, he trusteth not his own life}</v>
      <v n="23">{Though} it be given him {to be} in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes {are} upon their ways.</v>
      <v n="24">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all {other}, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn. {are gone: Heb. are not} {taken...: Heb. closed up}</v>
      <v n="25">And if {it be} not {so} now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</v>
