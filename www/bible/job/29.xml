      <v n="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, {continued: Heb. added to take up}</v>
      <v n="2">Oh that I were as {in} months past, as {in} the days {when} God preserved me;</v>
      <v n="3">When his candle shined upon my head, {and when} by his light I walked {through} darkness; {candle: or, lamp}</v>
      <v n="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God {was} upon my tabernacle;</v>
      <v n="5">When the Almighty {was} yet with me, {when} my children {were} about me;</v>
      <v n="6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; {me: Heb. with me}</v>
      <v n="7">When I went out to the gate through the city, {when} I prepared my seat in the street!</v>
      <v n="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, {and} stood up.</v>
      <v n="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid {their} hand on their mouth.</v>
      <v n="10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. {The nobles...: Heb. The voice of the nobles was hid}</v>
      <v n="11">When the ear heard {me}, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw {me}, it gave witness to me:</v>
      <v n="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and {him that had} none to help him.</v>
      <v n="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</v>
      <v n="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment {was} as a robe and a diadem.</v>
      <v n="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet {was} I to the lame.</v>
      <v n="16">I {was} a father to the poor: and the cause {which} I knew not I searched out.</v>
      <v n="17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth. {the jaws: Heb. the jawteeth, or, the grinders} {plucked: Heb. cast}</v>
      <v n="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply {my} days as the sand.</v>
      <v n="19">My root {was} spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch. {spread...: Heb. opened}</v>
      <v n="20">My glory {was} fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. {fresh: Heb. new} {renewed: Heb. changed}</v>
      <v n="21">Unto me {men} gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</v>
      <v n="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</v>
      <v n="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide {as} for the latter rain.</v>
      <v n="24">{If} I laughed on them, they believed {it} not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</v>
      <v n="25">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one {that} comforteth the mourners.</v>
