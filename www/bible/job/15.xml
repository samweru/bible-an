      <v n="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? {vain...: Heb. knowledge of wind}</v>
      <v n="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</v>
      <v n="4">Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. {castest...: Heb. makest void} {prayer: or, speech}</v>
      <v n="5">For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. {uttereth: Heb. teacheth}</v>
      <v n="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</v>
      <v n="7">{Art} thou the first man {that} was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</v>
      <v n="8">Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</v>
      <v n="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? {what} understandest thou, which {is} not in us?</v>
      <v n="10">With us {are} both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</v>
      <v n="11">{Are} the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</v>
      <v n="12">Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</v>
      <v n="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest {such} words go out of thy mouth?</v>
      <v n="14">What {is} man, that he should be clean? and {he which is} born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</v>
      <v n="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</v>
      <v n="16">How much more abominable and filthy {is} man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</v>
      <v n="17">I will shew thee, hear me; and that {which} I have seen I will declare;</v>
      <v n="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid {it}:</v>
      <v n="19">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</v>
      <v n="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all {his} days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</v>
      <v n="21">A dreadful sound {is} in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. {A dreadful...: Heb. A sound of fears}</v>
      <v n="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</v>
      <v n="23">He wandereth abroad for bread, {saying}, Where {is it}? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</v>
      <v n="24">Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</v>
      <v n="25">For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</v>
      <v n="26">He runneth upon him, {even} on {his} neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</v>
      <v n="27">Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on {his} flanks.</v>
      <v n="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, {and} in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</v>
      <v n="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</v>
      <v n="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</v>
      <v n="31">Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</v>
      <v n="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green. {accomplished: or, cut off}</v>
      <v n="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</v>
      <v n="34">For the congregation of hypocrites {shall be} desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</v>
      <v n="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit. {vanity: or, iniquity}</v>
