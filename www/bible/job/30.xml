      <v n="1">But now {they that are} younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. {younger...: Heb. of fewer days than I}</v>
      <v n="2">Yea, whereto {might} the strength of their hands {profit} me, in whom old age was perished?</v>
      <v n="3">For want and famine {they were} solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste. {solitary: or, dark as the night} {in...: Heb. yesternight}</v>
      <v n="4">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots {for} their meat.</v>
      <v n="5">They were driven forth from among {men}, (they cried after them as {after} a thief;)</v>
      <v n="6">To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, {in} caves of the earth, and {in} the rocks. {caves: Heb. holes}</v>
      <v n="7">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</v>
      <v n="8">{They were} children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. {base...: Heb. men of no name}</v>
      <v n="9">And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</v>
      <v n="10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. {and...: Heb. and withhold not spittle from}</v>
      <v n="11">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</v>
      <v n="12">Upon {my} right {hand} rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</v>
      <v n="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</v>
      <v n="14">They came {upon me} as a wide breaking in {of waters}: in the desolation they rolled themselves {upon me}.</v>
      <v n="15">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud. {my soul: Heb. my principal one}</v>
      <v n="16">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</v>
      <v n="17">My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</v>
      <v n="18">By the great force {of my disease} is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</v>
      <v n="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</v>
      <v n="20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me {not}.</v>
      <v n="21">Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me. {become...: Heb. turned to be cruel} {thy...: Heb. the strength of thy hand}</v>
      <v n="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride {upon it}, and dissolvest my substance. {substance: or, wisdom}</v>
      <v n="23">For I know {that} thou wilt bring me {to} death, and {to} the house appointed for all living.</v>
      <v n="24">Howbeit he will not stretch out {his} hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. {grave: Heb. heap}</v>
      <v n="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was {not} my soul grieved for the poor? {in trouble: Heb. hard of day?}</v>
      <v n="26">When I looked for good, then evil came {unto me}: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</v>
      <v n="27">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</v>
      <v n="28">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, {and} I cried in the congregation.</v>
      <v n="29">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. {owls: or, ostriches}</v>
      <v n="30">My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</v>
      <v n="31">My harp also is {turned} to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</v>
