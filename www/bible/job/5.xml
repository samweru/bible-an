      <v n="1">Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? {turn: or, look?}</v>
      <v n="2">For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. {envy: or, indignation}</v>
      <v n="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</v>
      <v n="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither {is there} any to deliver {them}.</v>
      <v n="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</v>
      <v n="6">Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; {affliction: or, iniquity}</v>
      <v n="7">Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. {trouble: or, labour} {sparks...: Heb. the sons of the burning coal lift up to fly}</v>
      <v n="8">I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</v>
      <v n="9">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number: {unsearchable: Heb. there is no search} {without...: Heb. till there be no number}</v>
      <v n="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: {fields: Heb. outplaces}</v>
      <v n="11">To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</v>
      <v n="12">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform {their} enterprise. {their enterprise: or, any thing}</v>
      <v n="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</v>
      <v n="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night. {meet...: or, run into}</v>
      <v n="15">But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</v>
      <v n="16">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</v>
      <v n="17">Behold, happy {is} the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</v>
      <v n="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</v>
      <v n="19">He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</v>
      <v n="20">In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword. {power: Heb. hands}</v>
      <v n="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. {from...: or, when the tongue scourgeth}</v>
      <v n="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</v>
      <v n="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</v>
      <v n="24">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle {shall be} in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. {thy tabernacle...: or, peace is thy tabernacle} {sin: or, err}</v>
      <v n="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed {shall be} great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth. {great: or, much}</v>
      <v n="26">Thou shalt come to {thy} grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. {cometh in: Heb. ascendeth}</v>
      <v n="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it {is}; hear it, and know thou {it} for thy good. {for...: Heb. for thyself}</v>
