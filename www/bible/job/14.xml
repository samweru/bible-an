      <v n="1">Man {that is} born of a woman {is} of few days, and full of trouble. {few...: Heb. short of days}</v>
      <v n="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</v>
      <v n="3">And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</v>
      <v n="4">Who can bring a clean {thing} out of an unclean? not one. {can...: Heb. will give}</v>
      <v n="5">Seeing his days {are} determined, the number of his months {are} with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</v>
      <v n="6">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day. {rest: Heb. cease}</v>
      <v n="7">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</v>
      <v n="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</v>
      <v n="9">{Yet} through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</v>
      <v n="10">But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where {is} he? {wasteth...: Heb. is weakened, or, cut off}</v>
      <v n="11">{As} the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</v>
      <v n="12">So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens {be} no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</v>
      <v n="13">O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</v>
      <v n="14">If a man die, shall he live {again}? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</v>
      <v n="15">Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</v>
      <v n="16">For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</v>
      <v n="17">My transgression {is} sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</v>
      <v n="18">And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. {cometh...: Heb. fadeth}</v>
      <v n="19">The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow {out} of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. {washest...: Heb. overflowest}</v>
      <v n="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</v>
      <v n="21">His sons come to honour, and he knoweth {it} not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth {it} not of them.</v>
      <v n="22">But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</v>
