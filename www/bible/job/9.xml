      <v n="1">Then Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">I know {it is} so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? {with God: or, before God?}</v>
      <v n="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</v>
      <v n="4">{He is} wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened {himself} against him, and hath prospered?</v>
      <v n="5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</v>
      <v n="6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</v>
      <v n="7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</v>
      <v n="8">Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. {waves: Heb. heights}</v>
      <v n="9">Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. {Arcturus...: Heb. Ash, Cesil, and Cimah}</v>
      <v n="10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</v>
      <v n="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see {him} not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</v>
      <v n="12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou? {hinder...: Heb. turn him away?}</v>
      <v n="13">{If} God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him. {proud...: Heb. helpers of pride, or, strength}</v>
      <v n="14">How much less shall I answer him, {and} choose out my words {to reason} with him?</v>
      <v n="15">Whom, though I were righteous, {yet} would I not answer, {but} I would make supplication to my judge.</v>
      <v n="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; {yet} would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</v>
      <v n="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</v>
      <v n="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</v>
      <v n="19">If {I speak} of strength, lo, {he is} strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time {to plead}?</v>
      <v n="20">If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: {if I say}, I {am} perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</v>
      <v n="21">{Though} I {were} perfect, {yet} would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</v>
      <v n="22">This {is} one {thing}, therefore I said {it}, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</v>
      <v n="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</v>
      <v n="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, {and} who {is} he?</v>
      <v n="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</v>
      <v n="26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle {that} hasteth to the prey. {swift...: or, ships of Ebeh: Heb. ships of desire}</v>
      <v n="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort {myself}:</v>
      <v n="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</v>
      <v n="29">{If} I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</v>
      <v n="30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</v>
      <v n="31">Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me. {abhor...: or, make me to be abhorred}</v>
      <v n="32">For {he is} not a man, as I {am, that} I should answer him, {and} we should come together in judgment.</v>
      <v n="33">Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, {that} might lay his hand upon us both. {any...: Heb. one that should argue} {daysman: or, umpire}</v>
      <v n="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</v>
      <v n="35">{Then} would I speak, and not fear him; but {it is} not so with me. {it is...: Heb. I am not so with myself}</v>
    </c>
