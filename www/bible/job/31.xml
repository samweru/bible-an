      <v n="1">I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</v>
      <v n="2">For what portion of God {is there} from above? and {what} inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</v>
      <v n="3">{Is} not destruction to the wicked? and a strange {punishment} to the workers of iniquity?</v>
      <v n="4">Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</v>
      <v n="5">If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</v>
      <v n="6">Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. {Let...: Heb. Let him weigh me in balances of justice}</v>
      <v n="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</v>
      <v n="8">{Then} let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</v>
      <v n="9">If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or {if} I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</v>
      <v n="10">{Then} let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</v>
      <v n="11">For this {is} an heinous crime; yea, it {is} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judges.</v>
      <v n="12">For it {is} a fire {that} consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</v>
      <v n="13">If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</v>
      <v n="14">What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</v>
      <v n="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? {did not one...: or, did he not fashion us in one womb?}</v>
      <v n="16">If I have withheld the poor from {their} desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</v>
      <v n="17">Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</v>
      <v n="18">(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as {with} a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) {her: that is, the widow}</v>
      <v n="19">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</v>
      <v n="20">If his loins have not blessed me, and {if} he were {not} warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</v>
      <v n="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</v>
      <v n="22">{Then} let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. {bone: or, chanelbone}</v>
      <v n="23">For destruction {from} God {was} a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</v>
      <v n="24">If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, {Thou art} my confidence;</v>
      <v n="25">If I rejoiced because my wealth {was} great, and because mine hand had gotten much; {gotten...: Heb. found much}</v>

      <v n="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: {my mouth...: Heb. my hand hath kissed my mouth}</v>
      <v n="28">This also {were} an iniquity {to be punished by} the judge: for I should have denied the God {that is} above.</v>
      <v n="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</v>
      <v n="30">Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. {mouth: Heb. palate}</v>
      <v n="31">If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</v>
      <v n="32">The stranger did not lodge in the street: {but} I opened my doors to the traveller. {traveller: or, way}</v>
      <v n="33">If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: {as Adam: or, after the manner of men}</v>
      <v n="34">Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, {and} went not out of the door?</v>
      <v n="35">Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire {is, that} the Almighty would answer me, and {that} mine adversary had written a book. {my...: or, my sign is that the Almighty will}</v>

      <v n="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</v>
      <v n="38">If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain; {complain: Heb. weep}</v>
      <v n="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: {fruits: Heb. strength} {the owners...: Heb. the soul of the owners thereof to expire, or, breathe out}</v>
      <v n="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. {cockle: or, noisome weeds}</v>
