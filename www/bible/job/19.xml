      <v n="1">Then Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</v>
      <v n="3">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed {that} ye make yourselves strange to me. {make...: or, harden yourselves against me}</v>
      <v n="4">And be it indeed {that} I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</v>
      <v n="5">If indeed ye will magnify {yourselves} against me, and plead against me my reproach:</v>
      <v n="6">Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</v>
      <v n="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but {there is} no judgment. {wrong: or, violence}</v>
      <v n="8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</v>
      <v n="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown {from} my head.</v>
      <v n="10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</v>
      <v n="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as {one of} his enemies.</v>
      <v n="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</v>
      <v n="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</v>
      <v n="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</v>
      <v n="15">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</v>
      <v n="16">I called my servant, and he gave {me} no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</v>
      <v n="17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's {sake} of mine own body. {mine...: Heb. my belly}</v>
      <v n="18">Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. {young...: or, the wicked}</v>
      <v n="19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. {my...: Heb. the men of my secret}</v>
      <v n="20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth. {and to: or, as to}</v>
      <v n="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</v>
      <v n="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</v>
      <v n="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! {Oh...: Heb. Who will give, etc}</v>
      <v n="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</v>
      <v n="25">For I know {that} my redeemer liveth, and {that} he shall stand at the latter {day} upon the earth:</v>
      <v n="26">And {though} after my skin {worms} destroy this {body}, yet in my flesh shall I see God: {And...: or, After I shall awake, though this body be destroyed, yet out of my flesh}</v>
      <v n="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; {though} my reins be consumed within me. {another: Heb. a stranger} {though...: or, my reins within me are consumed with earnest desire (for that day} {within...: Heb. in my bosom}</v>
      <v n="28">But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me? {seeing...: or, and what root of matter is found in me?}</v>
      <v n="29">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath {bringeth} the punishments of the sword, that ye may know {there is} a judgment.</v>
