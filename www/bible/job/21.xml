      <v n="1">But Job answered and said,</v>
      <v n="2">Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</v>
      <v n="3">Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</v>
      <v n="4">As for me, {is} my complaint to man? and if {it were so}, why should not my spirit be troubled? {troubled: Heb. shortened?}</v>
      <v n="5">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay {your} hand upon {your} mouth. {Mark...: Heb. Look unto me}</v>
      <v n="6">Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</v>
      <v n="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</v>
      <v n="8">Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</v>
      <v n="9">Their houses {are} safe from fear, neither {is} the rod of God upon them. {safe...: Heb. peace from}</v>
      <v n="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</v>
      <v n="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</v>
      <v n="12">They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</v>
      <v n="13">They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. {in wealth: or, in mirth}</v>
      <v n="14">Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</v>
      <v n="15">What {is} the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</v>
      <v n="16">Lo, their good {is} not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</v>
      <v n="17">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and {how oft} cometh their destruction upon them! {God} distributeth sorrows in his anger. {candle: or, lamp}</v>
      <v n="18">They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. {carrieth: Heb. stealeth}</v>
      <v n="19">God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know {it}. {his iniquity: that is, the punishment of his iniquity}</v>
      <v n="20">His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</v>
      <v n="21">For what pleasure {hath} he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</v>
      <v n="22">Shall {any} teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</v>
      <v n="23">One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. {his...: Heb. his very, or, the strength of, his perfection}</v>
      <v n="24">His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. {breasts: or, milk pails}</v>
      <v n="25">And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</v>
      <v n="26">They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</v>
      <v n="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices {which} ye wrongfully imagine against me.</v>
      <v n="28">For ye say, Where {is} the house of the prince? and where {are} the dwelling places of the wicked? {the dwelling...: Heb. the tent of the tabernacles}</v>
      <v n="29">Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</v>
      <v n="30">That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. {wrath: Heb. wraths}</v>
      <v n="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him {what} he hath done?</v>
      <v n="32">Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. {grave: Heb. graves} {remain...: Heb. watch in the heap}</v>
      <v n="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as {there are} innumerable before him.</v>
      <v n="34">How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? {falsehood: Heb. transgression?}</v>
