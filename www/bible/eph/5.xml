      <v n="1">Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</v>
      <v n="2">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</v>
      <v n="3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</v>
      <v n="4">Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</v>
      <v n="5">For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</v>
      <v n="6">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. {disobedience: or, unbelief}</v>
      <v n="7">Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</v>
      <v n="8">For ye were sometimes darkness, but now {are ye} light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</v>
      <v n="9">(For the fruit of the Spirit {is} in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</v>
      <v n="10">Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</v>
      <v n="11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove {them}.</v>
      <v n="12">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</v>
      <v n="13">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. {reproved: or, discovered}</v>
      <v n="14">Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. {he: or, it}</v>
      <v n="15">See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</v>
      <v n="16">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</v>
      <v n="17">Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord {is}.</v>
      <v n="18">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</v>
      <v n="19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</v>
      <v n="20">Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</v>
      <v n="21">Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</v>
      <v n="22">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</v>
      <v n="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</v>
      <v n="24">Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so {let} the wives {be} to their own husbands in every thing.</v>
      <v n="25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</v>
      <v n="26">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</v>
      <v n="27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</v>
      <v n="28">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</v>
      <v n="29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</v>
      <v n="30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</v>
      <v n="31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</v>
      <v n="32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</v>
      <v n="33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife {see} that she reverence {her} husband.</v>
