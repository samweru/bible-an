      <v n="1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</v>
      <v n="2">If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</v>
      <v n="3">How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, {afore...: or, a little before}</v>
      <v n="4">Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</v>
      <v n="5">Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</v>
      <v n="6">That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</v>
      <v n="7">Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</v>
      <v n="8">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</v>
      <v n="9">And to make all {men} see what {is} the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</v>
      <v n="10">To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly {places} might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</v>
      <v n="11">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</v>
      <v n="12">In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</v>
      <v n="13">Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</v>
      <v n="14">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</v>
      <v n="15">Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</v>
      <v n="16">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</v>
      <v n="17">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</v>
      <v n="18">May be able to comprehend with all saints what {is} the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</v>
      <v n="19">And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</v>
      <v n="20">Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</v>
      <v n="21">Unto him {be} glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</v>
