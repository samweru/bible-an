      <v n="1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</v>
      <v n="2">Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</v>
      <v n="3">That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</v>
      <v n="4">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</v>
      <v n="5">Servants, be obedient to them that are {your} masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</v>
      <v n="6">Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</v>
      <v n="7">With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</v>
      <v n="8">Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether {he be} bond or free.</v>
      <v n="9">And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. {forbearing: or, moderating} {your...: some read, both your and their Master}</v>
      <v n="10">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</v>
      <v n="11">Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</v>
      <v n="12">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high {places}. {flesh...: Gr. blood and flesh} {spiritual...: or, wicked spirits} {high: or, heavenly}</v>
      <v n="13">Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. {having...: or, having overcome all}</v>
      <v n="14">Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</v>
      <v n="15">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</v>
      <v n="16">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</v>
      <v n="17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</v>
      <v n="18">Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</v>
      <v n="19">And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</v>
      <v n="20">For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. {in bonds: or, in a chain} {therein: or, thereof}</v>
      <v n="21">But that ye also may know my affairs, {and} how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</v>
      <v n="22">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and {that} he might comfort your hearts.</v>
      <v n="23">Peace {be} to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v n="24">Grace {be} with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. «{To the} Ephesians written from Rome, by Tychicus.» {in sincerity: or, with incorruption}</v>
