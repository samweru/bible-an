      <v n="1">And he spake a parable unto them {to this end}, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</v>
      <v n="2">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: {in a city: Gr. in a certain city}</v>
      <v n="3">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</v>
      <v n="4">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</v>
      <v n="5">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</v>
      <v n="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</v>
      <v n="7">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</v>
      <v n="8">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</v>
      <v n="9">And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: {that...: or, as being righteous}</v>
      <v n="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</v>
      <v n="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men {are}, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</v>
      <v n="12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</v>
      <v n="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as {his} eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</v>
      <v n="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified {rather} than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</v>
      <v n="15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when {his} disciples saw {it}, they rebuked them.</v>
      <v n="16">But Jesus called them {unto him}, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="17">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</v>
      <v n="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</v>
      <v n="19">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none {is} good, save one, {that is}, God.</v>
      <v n="20">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</v>
      <v n="21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</v>
      <v n="22">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</v>
      <v n="23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</v>
      <v n="24">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</v>
      <v n="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="26">And they that heard {it} said, Who then can be saved?</v>
      <v n="27">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</v>
      <v n="28">Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</v>
      <v n="29">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</v>
      <v n="30">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</v>
      <v n="31">Then he took {unto him} the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</v>
      <v n="32">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</v>
      <v n="33">And they shall scourge {him}, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</v>
      <v n="34">And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</v>
      <v n="35">And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</v>
      <v n="36">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</v>
      <v n="37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</v>
      <v n="38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, {thou} Son of David, have mercy on me.</v>
      <v n="39">And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, {Thou} Son of David, have mercy on me.</v>
      <v n="40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</v>
      <v n="41">Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</v>
      <v n="42">And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</v>
      <v n="43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw {it}, gave praise unto God.</v>
