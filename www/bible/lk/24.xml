      <v n="1">Now upon the first {day} of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain {others} with them.</v>
      <v n="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</v>
      <v n="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</v>
      <v n="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</v>
      <v n="5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down {their} faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? {the living: or, him that liveth}</v>
      <v n="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</v>
      <v n="7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</v>
      <v n="8">And they remembered his words,</v>
      <v n="9">And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</v>
      <v n="10">It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary {the mother} of James, and other {women that were} with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</v>
      <v n="11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</v>
      <v n="12">Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</v>
      <v n="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem {about} threescore furlongs.</v>
      <v n="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</v>
      <v n="15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed {together} and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</v>
      <v n="16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</v>
      <v n="17">And he said unto them, What manner of communications {are} these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</v>
      <v n="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</v>
      <v n="19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</v>
      <v n="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</v>
      <v n="21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</v>
      <v n="22">Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</v>
      <v n="23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</v>
      <v n="24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found {it} even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</v>
      <v n="25">Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</v>
      <v n="26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</v>
      <v n="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</v>
      <v n="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</v>
      <v n="29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</v>
      <v n="30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed {it}, and brake, and gave to them.</v>
      <v n="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. {vanished...: or, ceased to be seen of them}</v>
      <v n="32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</v>
      <v n="33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</v>
      <v n="34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</v>
      <v n="35">And they told what things {were done} in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</v>
      <v n="36">And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace {be} unto you.</v>
      <v n="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</v>
      <v n="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</v>
      <v n="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</v>
      <v n="40">And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them {his} hands and {his} feet.</v>
      <v n="41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</v>
      <v n="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</v>
      <v n="43">And he took {it}, and did eat before them.</v>
      <v n="44">And he said unto them, These {are} the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and {in} the prophets, and {in} the psalms, concerning me.</v>
      <v n="45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</v>
      <v n="46">And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</v>
      <v n="47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</v>
      <v n="48">And ye are witnesses of these things.</v>
      <v n="49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</v>
      <v n="50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</v>
      <v n="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</v>
      <v n="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</v>
      <v n="53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</v>
