      <v n="1">And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</v>
      <v n="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this {fellow} perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</v>
      <v n="3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest {it}.</v>
      <v n="4">Then said Pilate to the chief priests and {to} the people, I find no fault in this man.</v>
      <v n="5">And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</v>
      <v n="6">When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</v>
      <v n="7">And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</v>
      <v n="8">And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long {season}, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</v>
      <v n="9">Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</v>
      <v n="10">And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</v>
      <v n="11">And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked {him}, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</v>
      <v n="12">And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</v>
      <v n="13">And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</v>
      <v n="14">Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined {him} before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</v>
      <v n="15">No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</v>
      <v n="16">I will therefore chastise him, and release {him}.</v>
      <v n="17">(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</v>
      <v n="18">And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this {man}, and release unto us Barabbas:</v>
      <v n="19">(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</v>
      <v n="20">Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</v>
      <v n="21">But they cried, saying, Crucify {him}, crucify him.</v>
      <v n="22">And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let {him} go.</v>
      <v n="23">And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</v>
      <v n="24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. {gave...: or, assented}</v>
      <v n="25">And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</v>
      <v n="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear {it} after Jesus.</v>
      <v n="27">And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</v>
      <v n="28">But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</v>
      <v n="29">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed {are} the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</v>
      <v n="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</v>
      <v n="31">For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</v>
      <v n="32">And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</v>
      <v n="33">And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. {Calvary: or, The place of a skull}</v>
      <v n="34">Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</v>
      <v n="35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided {him}, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</v>
      <v n="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</v>
      <v n="37">And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</v>
      <v n="38">And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</v>
      <v n="39">And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</v>
      <v n="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</v>
      <v n="41">And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</v>
      <v n="42">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</v>
      <v n="43">And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</v>
      <v n="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. {earth: or, land}</v>
      <v n="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</v>
      <v n="46">And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</v>
      <v n="47">Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</v>
      <v n="48">And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</v>
      <v n="49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</v>
      <v n="50">And, behold, {there was} a man named Joseph, a counsellor; {and he was} a good man, and a just:</v>
      <v n="51">(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) {he was} of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="52">This {man} went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</v>
      <v n="53">And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</v>
      <v n="54">And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</v>
      <v n="55">And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</v>
      <v n="56">And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</v>
