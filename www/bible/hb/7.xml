      <v n="1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</v>
      <v n="2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</v>
      <v n="3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually. {without descent: Gr. without pedigree}</v>
      <v n="4">Now consider how great this man {was}, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</v>
      <v n="5">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</v>
      <v n="6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. {descent: or, pedigree}</v>
      <v n="7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</v>
      <v n="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he {receiveth them}, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</v>
      <v n="9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</v>
      <v n="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</v>
      <v n="11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need {was there} that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</v>
      <v n="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</v>
      <v n="13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</v>
      <v n="14">For {it is} evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</v>
      <v n="15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</v>
      <v n="16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</v>
      <v n="17">For he testifieth, Thou {art} a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</v>
      <v n="18">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</v>
      <v n="19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope {did}; by the which we draw nigh unto God. {the bringing...: or, it was the bringing in}</v>
      <v n="20">And inasmuch as not without an oath {he was made priest}:</v>
      <v n="21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou {art} a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) {without...: or, without swearing of an oath}</v>
      <v n="22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</v>
      <v n="23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</v>
      <v n="24">But this {man}, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. {an...: or, which passeth not from one to another}</v>
      <v n="25">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. {to the...: or, evermore}</v>
      <v n="26">For such an high priest became us, {who is} holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</v>
      <v n="27">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</v>
      <v n="28">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, {maketh} the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. {consecrated: Gr. perfected}</v>
