      <v n="1">Let brotherly love continue.</v>
      <v n="2">Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</v>
      <v n="3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; {and} them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</v>
      <v n="4">Marriage {is} honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</v>
      <v n="5">{Let your} conversation {be} without covetousness; {and be} content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</v>
      <v n="6">So that we may boldly say, The Lord {is} my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</v>

      <v n="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</v>
      <v n="13">Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</v>
      <v n="14">For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</v>
