      <v n="1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, {principles...: or, word of the beginning of}</v>
      <v n="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</v>
      <v n="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</v>
      <v n="4">For {it is} impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</v>
      <v n="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</v>
      <v n="6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put {him} to an open shame.</v>
      <v n="7">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: {by: or, for}</v>
      <v n="8">But that which beareth thorns and briers {is} rejected, and {is} nigh unto cursing; whose end {is} to be burned.</v>
      <v n="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</v>
      <v n="10">For God {is} not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</v>
      <v n="11">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</v>
      <v n="12">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</v>
      <v n="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</v>
      <v n="14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</v>
      <v n="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</v>
      <v n="16">For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation {is} to them an end of all strife.</v>
      <v n="17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed {it} by an oath: {confirmed...: Gr. interposed himself by}</v>
      <v n="18">That by two immutable things, in which {it was} impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</v>
      <v n="19">Which {hope} we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</v>
      <v n="20">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, {even} Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</v>
