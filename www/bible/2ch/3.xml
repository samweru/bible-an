      <v n="1">Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where {the LORD} appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. {where...: or, which was seen of David his father} {Ornan: also called, Araunah}</v>
      <v n="2">And he began to build in the second {day} of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</v>
      <v n="3">Now these {are the things wherein} Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure {was} threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. {instructed: Heb. founded}</v>
      <v n="4">And the porch that {was} in the front {of the house}, the length {of it was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height {was} an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</v>
      <v n="5">And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</v>
      <v n="6">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold {was} gold of Parvaim. {garnished: Heb. covered}</v>
      <v n="7">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.</v>
      <v n="8">And he made the most holy house, the length whereof {was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, {amounting} to six hundred talents.</v>
      <v n="9">And the weight of the nails {was} fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</v>
      <v n="10">And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold. {image...: or, (as some think) of moveable work}</v>
      <v n="11">And the wings of the cherubims {were} twenty cubits long: one wing {of the one cherub was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing {was likewise} five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</v>
      <v n="12">And {one} wing of the other cherub {was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing {was} five cubits {also}, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</v>
      <v n="13">The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces {were} inward. {inward: or, toward the house}</v>
      <v n="14">And he made the vail {of} blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. {wrought: Heb. caused to ascend}</v>
      <v n="15">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that {was} on the top of each of them {was} five cubits. {high: Heb. long}</v>
      <v n="16">And he made chains, {as} in the oracle, and put {them} on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put {them} on the chains.</v>
      <v n="17">And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. {Jachin: that is, He shall establish} {Boaz: that is, In it is strength}</v>
