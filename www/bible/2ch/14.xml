      <v n="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</v>
      <v n="2">And Asa did {that which was} good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</v>
      <v n="3">For he took away the altars of the strange {gods}, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: {images: Heb. statues}</v>
      <v n="4">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</v>
      <v n="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. {images: Heb. sun images}</v>
      <v n="6">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</v>
      <v n="7">Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about {them} walls, and towers, gates, and bars, {while} the land {is} yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought {him}, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</v>
      <v n="8">And Asa had an army {of men} that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these {were} mighty men of valour.</v>
      <v n="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</v>
      <v n="10">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</v>
      <v n="11">And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, {it is} nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou {art} our God; let not man prevail against thee. {man: or, mortal man}</v>
      <v n="12">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</v>
      <v n="13">And Asa and the people that {were} with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. {destroyed: Heb. broken}</v>
      <v n="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</v>
      <v n="15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</v>
