      <v n="1">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away {the punishment} thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</v>
      <v n="2">But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, {and} with the sound of the trumpet:</v>
      <v n="3">And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="4">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away {the punishment} thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</v>
      <v n="5">But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</v>
      <v n="6">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away {the punishment} thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</v>
      <v n="7">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the {same} maid, to profane my holy name: {maid: or, young woman}</v>
      <v n="8">And they lay {themselves} down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned {in} the house of their god. {the condemned: or, such as have fined, or, mulcted}</v>
      <v n="9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height {was} like the height of the cedars, and he {was} strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</v>
      <v n="10">Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</v>
      <v n="11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. {Is it} not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="12">But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</v>
      <v n="13">Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed {that is} full of sheaves. {I am...: or, I will press your place, as a cart full of sheaves presseth}</v>
      <v n="14">Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself: {himself: Heb. his soul, or, life}</v>
      <v n="15">Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and {he that is} swift of foot shall not deliver {himself}: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</v>
      <v n="16">And {he that is} courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD. {courageous: Heb. strong of his heart}</v>
