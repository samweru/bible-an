      <v n="1">Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that {are} in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</v>
      <v n="2">The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</v>
      <v n="3">And ye shall go out at the breaches, every {cow at that which is} before her; and ye shall cast {them} into the palace, saith the LORD. {cast...: or, cast away the things of the palace}</v>
      <v n="4">Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, {and} your tithes after three years: {three...: Heb. three years of days}</v>
      <v n="5">And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim {and} publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. {offer: Heb. offer by burning} {this...: Heb. so ye love}</v>
      <v n="6">And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="7">And also I have withholden the rain from you, when {there were} yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</v>
      <v n="8">So two {or} three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured {them}: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. {when...: or, the multitude of your gardens, etc. did the palmerworm}</v>
      <v n="10">I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. {after...: or, in the way} {and have...: Heb. with the captivity of your horses}</v>
      <v n="11">I have overthrown {some} of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: {and} because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</v>
      <v n="13">For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what {is} his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, {is} his name. {wind: or, spirit}</v>
