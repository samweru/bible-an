      <v n="1">And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: {of} shittim wood shalt thou make it.</v>
      <v n="2">A cubit {shall be} the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits {shall be} the height thereof: the horns thereof {shall be} of the same.</v>
      <v n="3">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. {top: Heb. roof} {sides: Heb. walls}</v>
      <v n="4">And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make {it}; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. {corners: Heb. ribs}</v>
      <v n="5">And thou shalt make the staves {of} shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.</v>
      <v n="6">And thou shalt put it before the vail that {is} by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that {is} over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.</v>
      <v n="7">And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. {sweet incense: Heb. incense of spices}</v>
      <v n="8">And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. {lighteth: or setteth up: Heb. causeth to ascend} {at even: Heb. between the two evenings}</v>
      <v n="9">Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.</v>
      <v n="10">And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it {is} most holy unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="11">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="12">When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when {thou} numberest them. {their number: Heb. them that are to be numbered}</v>
      <v n="13">This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel {is} twenty gerahs:) an half shekel {shall be} the offering of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="14">Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="15">The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when {they} give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. {give more: Heb. multiply} {give less: Heb. diminish}</v>
      <v n="16">And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</v>
      <v n="17">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="18">Thou shalt also make a laver {of} brass, and his foot {also of} brass, to wash {withal}: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.</v>
      <v n="19">For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:</v>
      <v n="20">When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:</v>
      <v n="21">So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, {even} to him and to his seed throughout their generations.</v>
      <v n="22">Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="23">Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred {shekels}, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, {even} two hundred and fifty {shekels}, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty {shekels},</v>
      <v n="24">And of cassia five hundred {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:</v>
      <v n="25">And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. {apothecary: or, perfumer}</v>
      <v n="26">And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,</v>
      <v n="27">And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,</v>
      <v n="28">And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.</v>
      <v n="29">And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.</v>
      <v n="30">And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that {they} may minister unto me in the priest's office.</v>
      <v n="31">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.</v>
      <v n="32">Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make {any other} like it, after the composition of it: it {is} holy, {and} it shall be holy unto you.</v>
      <v n="33">Whosoever compoundeth {any} like it, or whosoever putteth {any} of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</v>
      <v n="34">And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; {these} sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like {weight}:</v>
      <v n="35">And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure {and} holy: {tempered...: Heb. salted}</v>
      <v n="36">And thou shalt beat {some} of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.</v>
      <v n="37">And {as for} the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.</v>
      <v n="38">Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</v>
