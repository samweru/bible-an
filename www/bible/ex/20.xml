      <v n="1">And God spake all these words, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">I {am} the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. {bondage: Heb. servants}</v>
      <v n="3">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} in the earth beneath, or that {is} in the water under the earth:</v>
      <v n="5">Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me;</v>
      <v n="6">And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</v>
      <v n="7">Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</v>
      <v n="8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</v>
      <v n="9">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</v>
      <v n="10">But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates:</v>
      <v n="11">For {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them {is}, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</v>
      <v n="12">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou shalt not kill.</v>
      <v n="14">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</v>
      <v n="15">Thou shalt not steal.</v>
      <v n="16">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</v>
      <v n="17">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that {is} thy neighbour's.</v>
      <v n="18">And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw {it}, they removed, and stood afar off.</v>
      <v n="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</v>
      <v n="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</v>
      <v n="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God {was}.</v>
      <v n="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</v>
      <v n="23">Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</v>
      <v n="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</v>
      <v n="25">And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. {build...: Heb. build them with hewing}</v>
      <v n="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</v>
