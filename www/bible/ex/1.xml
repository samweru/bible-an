      <v n="1">Now these {are} the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</v>
      <v n="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</v>
      <v n="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</v>
      <v n="4">Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</v>
      <v n="5">And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt {already}. {loins: Heb. thigh}</v>
      <v n="6">And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</v>
      <v n="7">And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</v>
      <v n="8">Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</v>
      <v n="9">And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel {are} more and mightier than we:</v>
      <v n="10">Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and {so} get them up out of the land.</v>
      <v n="11">Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</v>
      <v n="12">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. {But...: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc}</v>
      <v n="13">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</v>
      <v n="14">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, {was} with rigour.</v>
      <v n="15">And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one {was} Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</v>
      <v n="16">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see {them} upon the stools; if it {be} a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it {be} a daughter, then she shall live.</v>
      <v n="17">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</v>
      <v n="18">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</v>
      <v n="19">And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women {are} not as the Egyptian women; for they {are} lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</v>
      <v n="20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</v>
      <v n="21">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</v>
      <v n="22">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</v>
