      <v n="1">And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; {Is it} not for you to know judgment?</v>
      <v n="2">Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</v>
      <v n="3">Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</v>
      <v n="4">Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</v>
      <v n="5">Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</v>
      <v n="6">Therefore night {shall be} unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. {that...: vision: Heb. from a vision} {that...: divine: Heb. from divining}</v>
      <v n="7">Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for {there is} no answer of God. {lips: Heb. upper lip}</v>
      <v n="8">But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</v>
      <v n="9">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</v>
      <v n="10">They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. {blood: Heb. bloods}</v>
      <v n="11">The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, {Is} not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us. {and say: Heb. saying}</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed {as} a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</v>
