      <v n="1">[A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD.] Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee. {of: or, for}</v>
      <v n="2">Hide not thy face from me in the day {when} I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day {when} I call answer me speedily.</v>
      <v n="3">For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. {like...: or, (as some read) into smoke}</v>
      <v n="4">My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</v>
      <v n="5">By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. {skin: or, flesh}</v>
      <v n="6">I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</v>
      <v n="7">I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</v>
      <v n="8">Mine enemies reproach me all the day; {and} they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</v>
      <v n="9">For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</v>
      <v n="10">Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</v>
      <v n="11">My days {are} like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</v>
      <v n="12">But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou shalt arise, {and} have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</v>
      <v n="14">For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</v>
      <v n="15">So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</v>
      <v n="16">When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</v>
      <v n="17">He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</v>
      <v n="18">This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</v>
      <v n="19">For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</v>
      <v n="20">To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; {those...: Heb. the children of death}</v>
      <v n="21">To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</v>
      <v n="22">When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</v>
      <v n="23">He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. {weakened: Heb. afflicted}</v>
      <v n="24">I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years {are} throughout all generations.</v>
      <v n="25">Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens {are} the work of thy hands.</v>
      <v n="26">They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: {endure: Heb. stand}</v>
      <v n="27">But thou {art} the same, and thy years shall have no end.</v>
      <v n="28">The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</v>
