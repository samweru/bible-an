      <v n="1">[A Prayer of Moses the man of God.] Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations. {A Prayer...: or, A Prayer, being a Psalm of Moses} {in...: Heb. in generation and generation}</v>
      <v n="2">Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou {art} God.</v>
      <v n="3">Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</v>
      <v n="4">For a thousand years in thy sight {are but} as yesterday when it is past, and {as} a watch in the night. {when...: or, when he hath passed them}</v>
      <v n="5">Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are {as} a sleep: in the morning {they are} like grass {which} groweth up. {groweth...: or, is changed}</v>
      <v n="6">In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</v>
      <v n="7">For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</v>
      <v n="8">Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret {sins} in the light of thy countenance.</v>
      <v n="9">For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale {that is told}. {passed...: Heb. turned away} {as a...: or, as a meditation}</v>
      <v n="10">The days of our years {are} threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength {they be} fourscore years, yet {is} their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. {The days...: Heb. As for the days of our years, in them are seventy years}</v>
      <v n="11">Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, {so is} thy wrath.</v>
      <v n="12">So teach {us} to number our days, that we may apply {our} hearts unto wisdom. {apply: Heb. cause to come}</v>
      <v n="13">Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</v>
      <v n="14">O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</v>
      <v n="15">Make us glad according to the days {wherein} thou hast afflicted us, {and} the years {wherein} we have seen evil.</v>
      <v n="16">Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</v>
      <v n="17">And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</v>
