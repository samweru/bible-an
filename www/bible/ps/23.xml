      <v n="1">[A Psalm of David.] The LORD {is} my shepherd; I shall not want.</v>
      <v n="2">He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. {green...: Heb. pastures of tender grass} {still...: Heb. waters of quietness}</v>
      <v n="3">He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</v>
      <v n="4">Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou {art} with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</v>
      <v n="5">Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. {anointest: Heb. makest fat}</v>
      <v n="6">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. {for ever: Heb. to length of days}</v>
