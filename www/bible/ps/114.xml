      <v n="1">When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</v>
      <v n="2">Judah was his sanctuary, {and} Israel his dominion.</v>
      <v n="3">The sea saw {it}, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</v>
      <v n="4">The mountains skipped like rams, {and} the little hills like lambs.</v>
      <v n="5">What {ailed} thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, {that} thou wast driven back?</v>
      <v n="6">Ye mountains, {that} ye skipped like rams; {and} ye little hills, like lambs?</v>
      <v n="7">Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</v>
      <v n="8">Which turned the rock {into} a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</v>
