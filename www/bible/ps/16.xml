      <v n="1">[Michtam of David.] Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. {Michtam: or, A golden Psalm}</v>
      <v n="2">{O my soul}, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou {art} my Lord: my goodness {extendeth} not to thee;</v>
      <v n="3">{But} to the saints that {are} in the earth, and {to} the excellent, in whom {is} all my delight.</v>
      <v n="4">Their sorrows shall be multiplied {that} hasten {after} another {god}: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. {hasten...: or, give gifts to another}</v>
      <v n="5">The LORD {is} the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. {of mine...: Heb. of my part}</v>
      <v n="6">The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant {places}; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</v>
      <v n="7">I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</v>
      <v n="8">I have set the LORD always before me: because {he is} at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</v>
      <v n="9">Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. {rest...: Heb. dwell confidently}</v>
      <v n="10">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</v>
      <v n="11">Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence {is} fulness of joy; at thy right hand {there are} pleasures for evermore.</v>
