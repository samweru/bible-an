      <v n="1">[Maschil of David; A Prayer when he was in the cave.] I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication. {Maschil...: or, A Psalm of David, giving instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</v>
      <v n="3">When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</v>
      <v n="4">I looked on {my} right hand, and beheld, but {there was} no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. {I looked...: or, Look on the right hand, and see} {failed...: Heb. perished from me} {cared...: Heb. sought after}</v>
      <v n="5">I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou {art} my refuge {and} my portion in the land of the living.</v>
      <v n="6">Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</v>
      <v n="7">Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</v>
