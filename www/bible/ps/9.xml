      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.] I will praise {thee}, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</v>
      <v n="2">I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</v>
      <v n="3">When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</v>
      <v n="4">For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. {maintained...: Heb. made my judgment} {judging right: Heb. judging in righteousness}</v>
      <v n="5">Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</v>
      <v n="6">O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. {O thou...: or, The destructions of the enemy are come to a perpetual end: and their cities hast thou destroyed, etc}</v>
      <v n="7">But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</v>
      <v n="8">And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</v>
      <v n="9">The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. {a refuge: Heb. an high place}</v>
      <v n="10">And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</v>
      <v n="11">Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</v>
      <v n="12">When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. {humble: or, afflicted}</v>
      <v n="13">Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble {which I suffer} of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</v>
      <v n="14">That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</v>
      <v n="15">The heathen are sunk down in the pit {that} they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</v>
      <v n="16">The LORD is known {by} the judgment {which} he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah. {Higgaion: that is, Meditation}</v>
      <v n="17">The wicked shall be turned into hell, {and} all the nations that forget God.</v>
      <v n="18">For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall {not} perish for ever.</v>
      <v n="19">Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</v>
      <v n="20">Put them in fear, O LORD: {that} the nations may know themselves {to be but} men. Selah.</v>
