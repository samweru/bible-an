      <v n="1">[A Psalm of David.] The earth {is} the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</v>
      <v n="2">For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.</v>
      <v n="3">Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?</v>
      <v n="4">He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. {He...: Heb. The clean of hands}</v>
      <v n="5">He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</v>
      <v n="6">This {is} the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. {O Jacob: or, O God of Jacob}</v>
      <v n="7">Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</v>
      <v n="8">Who {is} this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.</v>
      <v n="9">Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift {them} up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</v>
      <v n="10">Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he {is} the King of glory. Selah.</v>
