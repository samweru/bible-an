      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David.] The LORD {is} my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD {is} the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</v>
      <v n="2">When the wicked, {even} mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. {came...: Heb. approached against me}</v>
      <v n="3">Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this {will} I {be} confident.</v>
      <v n="4">One {thing} have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. {the beauty: or, the delight}</v>
      <v n="5">For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</v>
      <v n="6">And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. {joy: Heb. shouting}</v>
      <v n="7">Hear, O LORD, {when} I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</v>
      <v n="8">{When thou saidst}, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. {When...: or, My heart said unto thee, Let my face seek thy face, etc}</v>
      <v n="9">Hide not thy face {far} from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</v>
      <v n="10">When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. {take...: Heb. gather me}</v>
      <v n="11">Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. {a plain...: Heb. a way of plainness} {mine...: Heb. those which observe me}</v>
      <v n="12">Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</v>
      <v n="13">{I had fainted}, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.</v>
      <v n="14">Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.</v>
