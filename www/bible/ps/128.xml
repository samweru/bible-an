      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees.] Blessed {is} every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.</v>
      <v n="2">For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy {shalt} thou {be}, and {it shall be} well with thee.</v>
      <v n="3">Thy wife {shall be} as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</v>
      <v n="4">Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.</v>
      <v n="5">The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</v>
      <v n="6">Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, {and} peace upon Israel.</v>
