      <v n="1">O give thanks unto the LORD, for {he is} good: for his mercy {endureth} for ever.</v>
      <v n="2">Let the redeemed of the LORD say {so}, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</v>
      <v n="3">And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. {south: Heb. sea}</v>
      <v n="4">They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</v>
      <v n="5">Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</v>
      <v n="6">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, {and} he delivered them out of their distresses.</v>
      <v n="7">And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</v>
      <v n="8">Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!</v>
      <v n="9">For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</v>
      <v n="10">Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, {being} bound in affliction and iron;</v>
      <v n="11">Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and {there was} none to help.</v>
      <v n="13">Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, {and} he saved them out of their distresses.</v>
      <v n="14">He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</v>
      <v n="15">Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!</v>
      <v n="16">For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</v>
      <v n="17">Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</v>
      <v n="18">Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</v>
      <v n="19">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, {and} he saveth them out of their distresses.</v>
      <v n="20">He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered {them} from their destructions.</v>
      <v n="21">Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!</v>
      <v n="22">And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. {rejoicing: Heb. singing}</v>
      <v n="23">They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</v>
      <v n="24">These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</v>
      <v n="25">For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. {raiseth: Heb. maketh to stand}</v>
      <v n="26">They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</v>
      <v n="27">They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end. {are...: Heb. all their wisdom is swallowed up}</v>
      <v n="28">Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</v>
      <v n="29">He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</v>
      <v n="30">Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</v>
      <v n="31">Oh that {men} would praise the LORD {for} his goodness, and {for} his wonderful works to the children of men!</v>
      <v n="32">Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</v>
      <v n="33">He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</v>
      <v n="34">A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. {barrenness: Heb. saltiness}</v>
      <v n="35">He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</v>
      <v n="36">And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</v>
      <v n="37">And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</v>
      <v n="38">He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</v>
      <v n="39">Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</v>
      <v n="40">He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, {where there is} no way. {wilderness: or, void place}</v>
      <v n="41">Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh {him} families like a flock. {from: or, after}</v>
      <v n="42">The righteous shall see {it}, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</v>
      <v n="43">Whoso {is} wise, and will observe these {things}, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</v>
