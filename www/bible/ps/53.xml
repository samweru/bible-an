      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, {A Psalm} of David.] The fool hath said in his heart, {There is} no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: {there is} none that doeth good. {Maschil: or, of instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were {any} that did understand, that did seek God.</v>
      <v n="3">Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; {there is} none that doeth good, no, not one.</v>
      <v n="4">Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people {as} they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</v>
      <v n="5">There were they in great fear, {where} no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth {against} thee: thou hast put {them} to shame, because God hath despised them. {were...: Heb. they feared a fear}</v>
      <v n="6">Oh that the salvation of Israel {were come} out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, {and} Israel shall be glad. {Oh that...: Heb. Who will give salvation, etc}</v>
