      <v n="1">[Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.] O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me: {words: or, business}</v>
      <v n="2">Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending {it} in pieces, while {there is} none to deliver. {none...: Heb. not a deliverer}</v>
      <v n="3">O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</v>
      <v n="4">If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</v>
      <v n="5">Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take {it}; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</v>
      <v n="6">Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me {to} the judgment {that} thou hast commanded.</v>
      <v n="7">So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</v>
      <v n="8">The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity {that is} in me.</v>
      <v n="9">Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</v>
      <v n="10">My defence {is} of God, which saveth the upright in heart. {My...: Heb. My buckler is upon God}</v>
      <v n="11">God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry {with the wicked} every day. {judgeth...: or, is a righteous judge}</v>
      <v n="12">If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</v>
      <v n="13">He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</v>
      <v n="14">Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</v>
      <v n="15">He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch {which} he made. {He made a pit: Heb. He hath digged a pit}</v>
      <v n="16">His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</v>
      <v n="17">I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</v>
