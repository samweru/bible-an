      <v n="1">The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, {wherewith} he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</v>
      <v n="2">Thy throne {is} established of old: thou {art} from everlasting. {of old: Heb. from then}</v>
      <v n="3">The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</v>
      <v n="4">The LORD on high {is} mightier than the noise of many waters, {yea, than} the mighty waves of the sea.</v>
      <v n="5">Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. {for ever: Heb. to length of days}</v>
