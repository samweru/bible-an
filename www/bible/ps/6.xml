      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.] O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. {chief...: or, overseer} {Sheminith: or, the eighth}</v>
      <v n="2">Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I {am} weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</v>
      <v n="3">My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?</v>
      <v n="4">Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.</v>
      <v n="5">For in death {there is} no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</v>
      <v n="6">I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. {all...: or, every night}</v>
      <v n="7">Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</v>
      <v n="8">Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.</v>
      <v n="9">The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.</v>
      <v n="10">Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return {and} be ashamed suddenly.</v>
