      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Neginah, {A Psalm} of David.] Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</v>
      <v n="2">From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock {that} is higher than I.</v>
      <v n="3">For thou hast been a shelter for me, {and} a strong tower from the enemy.</v>
      <v n="4">I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. {trust: or, make my refuge}</v>
      <v n="5">For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given {me} the heritage of those that fear thy name.</v>
      <v n="6">Thou wilt prolong the king's life: {and} his years as many generations. {Thou...: Heb. Thou shalt add days to the days of the king} {as...: Heb. as generation and generation}</v>
      <v n="7">He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, {which} may preserve him.</v>
      <v n="8">So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</v>
