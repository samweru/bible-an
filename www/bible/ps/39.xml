      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {even} to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.] I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. {my mouth...: Heb. a bridle, or, muzzle for my mouth}</v>
      <v n="2">I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, {even} from good; and my sorrow was stirred. {stirred: Heb. troubled}</v>
      <v n="3">My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: {then} spake I with my tongue,</v>
      <v n="4">LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it {is; that} I may know how frail I {am}. {how...: or, what time I have here}</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, thou hast made my days {as} an handbreadth; and mine age {is} as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state {is} altogether vanity. Selah. {at...: Heb. settled}</v>
      <v n="6">Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up {riches}, and knoweth not who shall gather them. {a vain...: Heb. an image}</v>
      <v n="7">And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope {is} in thee.</v>
      <v n="8">Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</v>
      <v n="9">I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst {it}.</v>
      <v n="10">Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. {blow: Heb. conflict}</v>
      <v n="11">When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man {is} vanity. Selah. {his...: Heb. that which is to be desired in him to melt away}</v>
      <v n="12">Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I {am} a stranger with thee, {and} a sojourner, as all my fathers {were}.</v>
      <v n="13">O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</v>
