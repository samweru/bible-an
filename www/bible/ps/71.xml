      <v n="1">In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</v>
      <v n="2">Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</v>
      <v n="3">Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou {art} my rock and my fortress. {Be...: Heb. Be thou to me for a rock of habitation}</v>
      <v n="4">Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</v>
      <v n="5">For thou {art} my hope, O Lord GOD: {thou art} my trust from my youth.</v>
      <v n="6">By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise {shall be} continually of thee.</v>
      <v n="7">I am as a wonder unto many; but thou {art} my strong refuge.</v>
      <v n="8">Let my mouth be filled {with} thy praise {and with} thy honour all the day.</v>
      <v n="9">Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</v>
      <v n="10">For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, {lay...: Heb. watch, or, observe}</v>
      <v n="11">Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for {there is} none to deliver {him}.</v>
      <v n="12">O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</v>
      <v n="13">Let them be confounded {and} consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered {with} reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</v>
      <v n="14">But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</v>
      <v n="15">My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness {and} thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers {thereof}.</v>
      <v n="16">I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, {even} of thine only.</v>
      <v n="17">O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</v>
      <v n="18">Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto {this} generation, {and} thy power to every one {that} is to come. {when...: Heb. unto old age and gray hairs} {thy strength: Heb. thine arm}</v>
      <v n="19">Thy righteousness also, O God, {is} very high, who hast done great things: O God, who {is} like unto thee!</v>
      <v n="20">{Thou}, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</v>
      <v n="21">Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</v>
      <v n="22">I will also praise thee with the psaltery, {even} thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. {the psaltery: Heb. the instrument of psaltery}</v>
      <v n="23">My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</v>
      <v n="24">My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</v>
