      <v n="1">[A Song {or} Psalm of Asaph.] Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. {of Asaph: or, for Asaph}</v>
      <v n="2">For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</v>
      <v n="3">They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</v>
      <v n="4">They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from {being} a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</v>
      <v n="5">For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee: {consent: Heb. heart}</v>
      <v n="6">The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</v>
      <v n="7">Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</v>
      <v n="8">Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. {holpen: Heb. been an arm to}</v>
      <v n="9">Do unto them as {unto} the Midianites; as {to} Sisera, as {to} Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</v>
      <v n="10">{Which} perished at Endor: they became {as} dung for the earth.</v>
      <v n="11">Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</v>
      <v n="12">Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</v>
      <v n="13">O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</v>
      <v n="14">As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</v>
      <v n="15">So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</v>
      <v n="16">Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</v>
      <v n="17">Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</v>
      <v n="18">That {men} may know that thou, whose name alone {is} JEHOVAH, {art} the most high over all the earth.</v>
