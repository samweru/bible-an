      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. {I waited...: Heb. In waiting I waited}</v>
      <v n="2">He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, {and} established my goings. {an...: Heb. a pit of noise}</v>
      <v n="3">And he hath put a new song in my mouth, {even} praise unto our God: many shall see {it}, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.</v>
      <v n="4">Blessed {is} that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</v>
      <v n="5">Many, O LORD my God, {are} thy wonderful works {which} thou hast done, and thy thoughts {which are} to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: {if} I would declare and speak {of them}, they are more than can be numbered. {they cannot...: or, none can order them unto thee}</v>
      <v n="6">Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. {opened: Heb. digged}</v>
      <v n="7">Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book {it is} written of me,</v>
      <v n="8">I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law {is} within my heart. {within...: Heb. in the midst of my bowels}</v>
      <v n="9">I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.</v>
      <v n="10">I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</v>
      <v n="11">Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</v>
      <v n="12">For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. {falleth: Heb. forsaketh}</v>
      <v n="13">Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.</v>
      <v n="14">Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</v>
      <v n="15">Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</v>
      <v n="16">Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.</v>
      <v n="17">But I {am} poor and needy; {yet} the Lord thinketh upon me: thou {art} my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</v>
