      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees.] When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. {turned...: Heb. returned the returning}</v>
      <v n="2">Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. {hath...: Heb. hath magnified to do with them}</v>
      <v n="3">The LORD hath done great things for us; {whereof} we are glad.</v>
      <v n="4">Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.</v>
      <v n="5">They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. {joy: or, singing}</v>
      <v n="6">He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves {with him}. {precious...: or, seed basket}</v>
