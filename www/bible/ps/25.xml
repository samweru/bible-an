      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David.] Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</v>
      <v n="2">O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</v>
      <v n="3">Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</v>
      <v n="4">Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.</v>
      <v n="5">Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou {art} the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</v>
      <v n="6">Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they {have been} ever of old. {tender...: Heb. bowels}</v>
      <v n="7">Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.</v>
      <v n="8">Good and upright {is} the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</v>
      <v n="9">The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</v>
      <v n="10">All the paths of the LORD {are} mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</v>
      <v n="11">For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it {is} great.</v>
      <v n="12">What man {is} he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way {that} he shall choose.</v>
      <v n="13">His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth. {dwell...: Heb. lodge in goodness}</v>
      <v n="14">The secret of the LORD {is} with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant. {and...: or, and his covenant to make them know it}</v>
      <v n="15">Mine eyes {are} ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net. {pluck: Heb. bring forth}</v>
      <v n="16">Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I {am} desolate and afflicted.</v>
      <v n="17">The troubles of my heart are enlarged: {O} bring thou me out of my distresses.</v>
      <v n="18">Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</v>
      <v n="19">Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. {cruel...: Heb. hatred of violence}</v>
      <v n="20">O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</v>
      <v n="21">Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</v>
      <v n="22">Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</v>
