      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</v>
      <v n="2">Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</v>
      <v n="3">Who whet their tongue like a sword, {and} bend {their bows to shoot} their arrows, {even} bitter words:</v>
      <v n="4">That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</v>
      <v n="5">They encourage themselves {in} an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them? {matter: or, speech} {of...: Heb. to hide his snares}</v>
      <v n="6">They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward {thought} of every one {of them}, and the heart, {is} deep. {they...: or, we are consumed by that which they have throughly searched} {a diligent...: Heb. a search searched}</v>
      <v n="7">But God shall shoot at them {with} an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded. {shall they...: Heb. their wound shall be}</v>
      <v n="8">So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</v>
      <v n="9">And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</v>
      <v n="10">The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</v>
