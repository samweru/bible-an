      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of Asaph.] I cried unto God with my voice, {even} unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. {of: or, for}</v>
      <v n="2">In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. {sore: Heb. hand}</v>
      <v n="3">I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</v>
      <v n="5">I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</v>
      <v n="6">I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</v>
      <v n="7">Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</v>
      <v n="8">Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth {his} promise fail for evermore? {for evermore: Heb. to generation and generation?}</v>
      <v n="9">Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</v>
      <v n="10">And I said, This {is} my infirmity: {but I will remember} the years of the right hand of the most High.</v>
      <v n="11">I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</v>
      <v n="12">I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</v>
      <v n="13">Thy way, O God, {is} in the sanctuary: who {is so} great a God as {our} God?</v>
      <v n="14">Thou {art} the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</v>
      <v n="15">Thou hast with {thine} arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</v>
      <v n="16">The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</v>
      <v n="17">The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. {poured...: Heb. were poured forth with water}</v>
      <v n="18">The voice of thy thunder {was} in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</v>
      <v n="19">Thy way {is} in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</v>
      <v n="20">Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</v>
