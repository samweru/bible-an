      <v n="3">He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</v>
      <v n="4">Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.</v>
      <v n="5">Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.</v>
      <v n="6">With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.</v>
      <v n="7">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. {the fulness...: or, all it containeth}</v>
      <v n="8">Let the floods clap {their} hands: let the hills be joyful together</v>
