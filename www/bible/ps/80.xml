      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Shoshannimeduth, A Psalm of Asaph.] Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest {between} the cherubims, shine forth. {of: or, for}</v>
      <v n="2">Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come {and} save us. {come...: Heb. come for salvation to us}</v>
      <v n="3">Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</v>
      <v n="4">O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? {be...: Heb. smoke}</v>
      <v n="5">Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</v>
      <v n="6">Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</v>
      <v n="7">Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</v>
      <v n="8">Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</v>
      <v n="9">Thou preparedst {room} before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</v>
      <v n="10">The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof {were like} the goodly cedars. {goodly...: Heb. cedars of God}</v>
      <v n="11">She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</v>
      <v n="12">Why hast thou {then} broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</v>
      <v n="13">The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</v>
      <v n="14">Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</v>
      <v n="15">And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch {that} thou madest strong for thyself.</v>
      <v n="16">{It is} burned with fire, {it is} cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</v>
      <v n="17">Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man {whom} thou madest strong for thyself.</v>
      <v n="18">So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</v>
      <v n="19">Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</v>
