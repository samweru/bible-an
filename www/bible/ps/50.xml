      <v n="1">[A Psalm of Asaph.] The mighty God, {even} the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. {of...: or, for Asaph}</v>
      <v n="2">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</v>
      <v n="3">Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</v>
      <v n="4">He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</v>
      <v n="5">Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</v>
      <v n="6">And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God {is} judge himself. Selah.</v>
      <v n="7">Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I {am} God, {even} thy God.</v>
      <v n="8">I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, {to have been} continually before me.</v>
      <v n="9">I will take no bullock out of thy house, {nor} he goats out of thy folds.</v>
      <v n="10">For every beast of the forest {is} mine, {and} the cattle upon a thousand hills.</v>
      <v n="11">I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field {are} mine. {mine: Heb. with me}</v>
      <v n="12">If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world {is} mine, and the fulness thereof.</v>
      <v n="13">Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</v>
      <v n="14">Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</v>
      <v n="15">And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</v>
      <v n="16">But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or {that} thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</v>
      <v n="17">Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</v>
      <v n="18">When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. {hast...: Heb. thy portion was with}</v>
      <v n="19">Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. {givest: Heb. sendest}</v>
      <v n="20">Thou sittest {and} speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</v>
      <v n="21">These {things} hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether {such an one} as thyself: {but} I will reprove thee, and set {them} in order before thine eyes.</v>
      <v n="22">Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear {you} in pieces, and {there be} none to deliver.</v>
      <v n="23">Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth {his} conversation {aright} will I shew the salvation of God. {that...: Heb. that disposeth his way}</v>
