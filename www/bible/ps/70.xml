      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David, to bring to remembrance.] {Make haste}, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. {to help...: Heb. to my help}</v>
      <v n="2">Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.</v>
      <v n="3">Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.</v>
      <v n="4">Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.</v>
      <v n="5">But I {am} poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou {art} my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.</v>
