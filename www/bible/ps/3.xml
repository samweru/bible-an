      <v n="2">Many {there be} which say of my soul, {There is} no help for him in God. Selah.</v>
      <v n="3">But thou, O LORD, {art} a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. {for: or, about}</v>
      <v n="4">I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</v>
      <v n="5">I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.</v>
      <v n="6">I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set {themselves} against me round about.</v>
      <v n="7">Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies {upon} the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</v>
