      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David.] In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee {as} a bird to your mountain?</v>
      <v n="2">For, lo, the wicked bend {their} bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart. {privily: Heb. in darkness}</v>
      <v n="3">If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</v>
      <v n="4">The LORD {is} in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne {is} in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</v>
      <v n="5">The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</v>
      <v n="6">Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: {this shall be} the portion of their cup. {an horrible...: or, a burning tempest}</v>
      <v n="7">For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</v>
    </c>
