      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Gittith, {A Psalm} of Asaph.] Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. {of Asaph: or, for Asaph}</v>
      <v n="2">Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</v>
      <v n="3">Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</v>
      <v n="4">For this {was} a statute for Israel, {and} a law of the God of Jacob.</v>
      <v n="5">This he ordained in Joseph {for} a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: {where} I heard a language {that} I understood not. {through: or, against}</v>
      <v n="6">I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. {were...: Heb. passed away}</v>
      <v n="7">Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah. {Meribah: or, Strife}</v>
      <v n="8">Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</v>
      <v n="9">There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</v>
      <v n="10">I {am} the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</v>
      <v n="11">But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</v>
      <v n="12">So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: {and} they walked in their own counsels. {unto...: or, to the hardness of their hearts, or, imagination}</v>
      <v n="13">Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, {and} Israel had walked in my ways!</v>
      <v n="14">I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</v>
      <v n="15">The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. {submitted...: or, yielded feigned obedience: Heb. lied}</v>
      <v n="16">He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. {finest...: Heb. fat of wheat}</v>
