      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, Maschil, {A Psalm} of David, when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, David is come to the house of Ahimelech.] Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God {endureth} continually. {Maschil: or, of instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">Thy tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</v>
      <v n="3">Thou lovest evil more than good; {and} lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou lovest all devouring words, O {thou} deceitful tongue. {O thou...: or, and the deceitful tongue}</v>
      <v n="5">God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of {thy} dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. {destroy...: Heb. beat thee down}</v>
      <v n="6">The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</v>
      <v n="7">Lo, {this is} the man {that} made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, {and} strengthened himself in his wickedness. {wickedness: or, substance}</v>
      <v n="8">But I {am} like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</v>
      <v n="9">I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done {it}: and I will wait on thy name; for {it is} good before thy saints.</v>
