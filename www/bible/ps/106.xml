      <v n="1">Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for {he is} good: for his mercy {endureth} for ever. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}</v>
      <v n="2">Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? {who} can shew forth all his praise?</v>
      <v n="3">Blessed {are} they that keep judgment, {and} he that doeth righteousness at all times.</v>
      <v n="4">Remember me, O LORD, with the favour {that thou bearest unto} thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</v>
      <v n="5">That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</v>
      <v n="6">We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</v>
      <v n="7">Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked {him} at the sea, {even} at the Red sea.</v>
      <v n="8">Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</v>
      <v n="9">He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</v>
      <v n="10">And he saved them from the hand of him that hated {them}, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</v>
      <v n="11">And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</v>
      <v n="12">Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</v>
      <v n="13">They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: {They soon...: Heb. They made haste, they forgat}</v>
      <v n="14">But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. {lusted...: Heb. lusted a lust}</v>
      <v n="15">And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</v>
      <v n="16">They envied Moses also in the camp, {and} Aaron the saint of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="17">The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</v>
      <v n="18">And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</v>
      <v n="19">They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</v>
      <v n="20">Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</v>
      <v n="21">They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</v>
      <v n="22">Wondrous works in the land of Ham, {and} terrible things by the Red sea.</v>
      <v n="23">Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy {them}.</v>
      <v n="24">Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: {the pleasant...: Heb. a land of desire}</v>
      <v n="25">But murmured in their tents, {and} hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="26">Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: {to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall}</v>
      <v n="27">To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. {to overthrow: Heb. to make them fall}</v>
      <v n="28">They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</v>
      <v n="29">Thus they provoked {him} to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</v>
      <v n="30">Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and {so} the plague was stayed.</v>
      <v n="31">And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</v>
      <v n="32">They angered {him} also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</v>
      <v n="33">Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</v>
      <v n="34">They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</v>
      <v n="35">But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</v>
      <v n="36">And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</v>
      <v n="37">Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</v>
      <v n="38">And shed innocent blood, {even} the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</v>
      <v n="39">Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</v>
      <v n="40">Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</v>
      <v n="41">And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</v>
      <v n="42">Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</v>
      <v n="43">Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked {him} with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. {brought...: or, impoverished, or, weakened}</v>
      <v n="44">Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</v>
      <v n="45">And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</v>
      <v n="46">He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</v>
      <v n="47">Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, {and} to triumph in thy praise.</v>
      <v n="48">Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}</v>
