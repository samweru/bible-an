      <v n="1">O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</v>
      <v n="2">Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</v>
      <v n="3">Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</v>
      <v n="4">Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</v>
      <v n="5">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</v>
      <v n="6">O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</v>
      <v n="7">He {is} the LORD our God: his judgments {are} in all the earth.</v>
      <v n="8">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations.</v>
      <v n="9">Which {covenant} he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</v>
      <v n="10">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant:</v>
      <v n="11">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance: {lot: Heb. cord}</v>
      <v n="12">When they were {but} a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</v>
      <v n="13">When they went from one nation to another, from {one} kingdom to another people;</v>
      <v n="14">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</v>
      <v n="15">{Saying}, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</v>
      <v n="16">Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</v>
      <v n="17">He sent a man before them, {even} Joseph, {who} was sold for a servant:</v>
      <v n="18">Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron: {he...: Heb. his soul came into iron}</v>
      <v n="19">Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</v>
      <v n="20">The king sent and loosed him; {even} the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</v>
      <v n="21">He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance: {substance: Heb. possession}</v>
      <v n="22">To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</v>
      <v n="23">Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</v>
      <v n="24">And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</v>
      <v n="25">He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</v>
      <v n="26">He sent Moses his servant; {and} Aaron whom he had chosen.</v>
      <v n="27">They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. {his...: Heb. words of his signs}</v>
      <v n="28">He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</v>
      <v n="29">He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</v>
      <v n="30">Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</v>
      <v n="31">He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, {and} lice in all their coasts.</v>
      <v n="32">He gave them hail for rain, {and} flaming fire in their land. {them...: Heb. their rain hail}</v>
      <v n="33">He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</v>
      <v n="34">He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</v>
      <v n="35">And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</v>
      <v n="36">He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</v>
      <v n="37">He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and {there was} not one feeble {person} among their tribes.</v>
      <v n="38">Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</v>
      <v n="39">He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</v>
      <v n="40">{The people} asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</v>
      <v n="41">He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places {like} a river.</v>
      <v n="42">For he remembered his holy promise, {and} Abraham his servant.</v>
      <v n="43">And he brought forth his people with joy, {and} his chosen with gladness: {gladness: Heb. singing}</v>
      <v n="44">And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</v>
      <v n="45">That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. {Praise...: Heb. Hallelujah}</v>
