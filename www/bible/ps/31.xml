      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</v>
      <v n="2">Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. {my...: Heb. to me for a rock of strength}</v>
      <v n="3">For thou {art} my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</v>
      <v n="4">Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou {art} my strength.</v>
      <v n="5">Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</v>
      <v n="6">I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</v>
      <v n="7">I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</v>
      <v n="8">And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</v>
      <v n="9">Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, {yea}, my soul and my belly.</v>
      <v n="10">For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</v>
      <v n="11">I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</v>
      <v n="12">I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel. {a broken...: Heb. a vessel that perisheth}</v>
      <v n="13">For I have heard the slander of many: fear {was} on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</v>
      <v n="14">But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou {art} my God.</v>
      <v n="15">My times {are} in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</v>
      <v n="16">Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</v>
      <v n="17">Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, {and} let them be silent in the grave. {silent...: or, cut off for}</v>
      <v n="18">Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. {grievous...: Heb. a hard thing}</v>
      <v n="19">{Oh} how great {is} thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; {which} thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</v>
      <v n="20">Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</v>
      <v n="21">Blessed {be} the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city. {strong: or, fenced}</v>
      <v n="22">For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</v>
      <v n="23">O love the LORD, all ye his saints: {for} the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</v>
      <v n="24">Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</v>
