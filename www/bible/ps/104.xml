      <v n="1">Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</v>
      <v n="2">Who coverest {thyself} with light as {with} a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</v>
      <v n="3">Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</v>
      <v n="4">Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</v>
      <v n="5">{Who} laid the foundations of the earth, {that} it should not be removed for ever. {Who...: Heb. He hath founded the earth upon her bases}</v>
      <v n="6">Thou coveredst it with the deep as {with} a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</v>
      <v n="7">At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</v>
      <v n="8">They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. {They go up...: or, The mountains ascend, the valleys descend}</v>
      <v n="9">Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</v>
      <v n="10">He sendeth the springs into the valleys, {which} run among the hills. {He: Heb. Who} {run: Heb. walk}</v>
      <v n="11">They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst. {quench: Heb. break}</v>
      <v n="12">By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, {which} sing among the branches. {sing: Heb. give a voice}</v>
      <v n="13">He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</v>
      <v n="14">He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</v>
      <v n="15">And wine {that} maketh glad the heart of man, {and} oil to make {his} face to shine, and bread {which} strengtheneth man's heart. {oil...: Heb. to make his face shine with oil, or, more than oil}</v>
      <v n="16">The trees of the LORD are full {of sap}; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</v>
      <v n="17">Where the birds make their nests: {as for} the stork, the fir trees {are} her house.</v>
      <v n="18">The high hills {are} a refuge for the wild goats; {and} the rocks for the conies.</v>
      <v n="19">He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</v>
      <v n="20">Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep {forth}. {beasts...: Heb. beasts thereof do trample on the forest}</v>
      <v n="21">The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</v>
      <v n="22">The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</v>
      <v n="23">Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</v>
      <v n="24">O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</v>
      <v n="25">{So is} this great and wide sea, wherein {are} things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</v>
      <v n="26">There go the ships: {there is} that leviathan, {whom} thou hast made to play therein. {made: Heb. formed}</v>
      <v n="27">These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give {them} their meat in due season.</v>
      <v n="28">{That} thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</v>
      <v n="29">Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</v>
      <v n="30">Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</v>
      <v n="31">The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works. {endure: Heb. be}</v>
      <v n="32">He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</v>
      <v n="33">I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</v>
      <v n="34">My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</v>
      <v n="35">Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</v>
