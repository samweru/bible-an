      <v n="1">The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad {thereof}. {multitude...: Heb. many, or, great isles}</v>
      <v n="2">Clouds and darkness {are} round about him: righteousness and judgment {are} the habitation of his throne. {habitation: or, establishment}</v>
      <v n="3">A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</v>
      <v n="4">His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</v>
      <v n="5">The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</v>
      <v n="6">The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</v>
      <v n="7">Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all {ye} gods.</v>
      <v n="8">Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">For thou, LORD, {art} high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</v>
      <v n="10">Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</v>
      <v n="11">Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</v>
      <v n="12">Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness. {at...: or, to the memorial}</v>
