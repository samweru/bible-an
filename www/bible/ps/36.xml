      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David the servant of the LORD.] The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, {that there is} no fear of God before his eyes.</v>
      <v n="2">For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. {until...: Heb. to find his iniquity to hate}</v>
      <v n="3">The words of his mouth {are} iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, {and} to do good.</v>
      <v n="4">He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way {that is} not good; he abhorreth not evil. {mischief: or, vanity}</v>
      <v n="5">Thy mercy, O LORD, {is} in the heavens; {and} thy faithfulness {reacheth} unto the clouds.</v>
      <v n="6">Thy righteousness {is} like the great mountains; thy judgments {are} a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. {the...: Heb. the mountains of God}</v>
      <v n="7">How excellent {is} thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. {excellent: Heb. precious}</v>
      <v n="8">They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. {abundantly...: Heb. watered}</v>
      <v n="9">For with thee {is} the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</v>
      <v n="10">O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart. {continue: Heb. draw out at length}</v>
      <v n="11">Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.</v>
      <v n="12">There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</v>
