      <v n="4">Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, {line: or, rule, or, direction}</v>
      <v n="5">Which {is} as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, {and} rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</v>

      <v n="11">Moreover by them is thy servant warned: {and} in keeping of them {there is} great reward.</v>
      <v n="12">Who can understand {his} errors? cleanse thou me from secret {faults}.</v>
      <v n="13">Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous {sins}; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. {the great: or, much}</v>
