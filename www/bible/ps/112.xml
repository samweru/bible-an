      <v n="2">His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</v>
      <v n="3">Wealth and riches {shall be} in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</v>
      <v n="4">Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: {he is} gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</v>
      <v n="5">A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion. {discretion: Heb. judgment}</v>
      <v n="6">Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</v>
      <v n="7">He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.</v>
      <v n="8">His heart {is} established, he shall not be afraid, until he see {his desire} upon his enemies.</v>
      <v n="9">He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</v>
      <v n="10">The wicked shall see {it}, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</v>
