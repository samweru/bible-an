      <v n="1">By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</v>
      <v n="2">We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</v>
      <v n="3">For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us {required of us} mirth, {saying}, Sing us {one} of the songs of Zion. {a song: Heb. the words of a song} {wasted...: Heb. laid us on heaps}</v>
      <v n="4">How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a strange land? {strange...: Heb. land of a stranger?}</v>
      <v n="5">If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget {her cunning}.</v>
      <v n="6">If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. {my chief...: Heb. the head of my joy}</v>
      <v n="7">Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase {it}, rase {it, even} to the foundation thereof. {Rase it: Heb. Make bare}</v>
      <v n="8">O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy {shall he be}, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us. {destroyed: Heb. wasted} {rewardeth...: Heb. recompenseth unto thee thy deed which thou didst to us}</v>
      <v n="9">Happy {shall he be}, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. {the stones: Heb. the rock}</v>
