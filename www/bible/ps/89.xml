      <v n="1">[Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.] I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations. {Maschil...: or, A Psalm for Ethan the Ezrahite, to give instruction} {to all...: Heb. to generation and generation}</v>
      <v n="2">For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</v>
      <v n="3">I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</v>
      <v n="4">Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</v>
      <v n="5">And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</v>
      <v n="6">For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? {who} among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</v>
      <v n="7">God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all {them that are} about him.</v>
      <v n="8">O LORD God of hosts, who {is} a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</v>
      <v n="9">Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</v>
      <v n="10">Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. {Rahab: or, Egypt} {thy...: Heb. the arm of thy strength}</v>
      <v n="11">The heavens {are} thine, the earth also {is} thine: {as for} the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. {the fulness...: or, all it containeth}</v>
      <v n="12">The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, {and} high is thy right hand. {a...: Heb. an arm with might}</v>
      <v n="14">Justice and judgment {are} the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. {habitation: or, establishment}</v>
      <v n="15">Blessed {is} the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</v>
      <v n="16">In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</v>
      <v n="17">For thou {art} the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</v>
      <v n="18">For the LORD {is} our defence; and the Holy One of Israel {is} our king. {the LORD...: or, our shield is of the LORD, and our king is of the Holy One of Israel}</v>
      <v n="19">Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon {one that is} mighty; I have exalted {one} chosen out of the people.</v>
      <v n="20">I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</v>
      <v n="21">With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</v>
      <v n="22">The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</v>
      <v n="23">And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</v>
      <v n="24">But my faithfulness and my mercy {shall be} with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</v>
      <v n="25">I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</v>
      <v n="26">He shall cry unto me, Thou {art} my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</v>
      <v n="27">Also I will make him {my} firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</v>
      <v n="28">My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</v>
      <v n="29">His seed also will I make {to endure} for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</v>
      <v n="30">If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</v>
      <v n="31">If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; {break: Heb. profane}</v>
      <v n="32">Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</v>
      <v n="33">Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. {will...: Heb. I will not make void from him} {to fall: Heb. to lie}</v>
      <v n="34">My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</v>
      <v n="35">Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. {that...: Heb. if I lie}</v>
      <v n="36">His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</v>
      <v n="37">It shall be established for ever as the moon, and {as} a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</v>
      <v n="38">But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</v>
      <v n="39">Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown {by casting it} to the ground.</v>
      <v n="40">Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</v>
      <v n="41">All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</v>
      <v n="42">Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</v>
      <v n="43">Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</v>
      <v n="44">Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. {glory: Heb. brightness}</v>
      <v n="45">The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</v>
      <v n="46">How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</v>
      <v n="47">Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</v>
      <v n="48">What man {is he that} liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</v>
      <v n="49">Lord, where {are} thy former lovingkindnesses, {which} thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</v>
      <v n="50">Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; {how} I do bear in my bosom {the reproach of} all the mighty people;</v>
      <v n="51">Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</v>
      <v n="52">Blessed {be} the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</v>
