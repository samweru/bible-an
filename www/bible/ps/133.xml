      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees of David.] Behold, how good and how pleasant {it is} for brethren to dwell together in unity! {together...: Heb. even together}</v>
      <v n="2">{It is} like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, {even} Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</v>
      <v n="3">As the dew of Hermon, {and as the dew} that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, {even} life for evermore.</v>
