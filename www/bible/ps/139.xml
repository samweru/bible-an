      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known {me}.</v>
      <v n="2">Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</v>
      <v n="3">Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted {with} all my ways. {compassest: or, winnowest}</v>
      <v n="4">For {there is} not a word in my tongue, {but}, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</v>
      <v n="5">Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</v>
      <v n="6">{Such} knowledge {is} too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot {attain} unto it.</v>
      <v n="7">Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</v>
      <v n="8">If I ascend up into heaven, thou {art} there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou {art there}.</v>
      <v n="9">{If} I take the wings of the morning, {and} dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</v>
      <v n="10">Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</v>
      <v n="11">If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</v>
      <v n="12">Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light {are} both alike {to thee}. {hideth...: Heb. darkeneth not} {the darkness and...: Heb. as is the darkness, so is the light}</v>
      <v n="13">For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</v>
      <v n="14">I will praise thee; for I am fearfully {and} wonderfully made: marvellous {are} thy works; and {that} my soul knoweth right well. {right...: Heb. greatly}</v>
      <v n="15">My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, {and} curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. {substance: or, strength, or, body}</v>
      <v n="16">Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all {my members} were written, {which} in continuance were fashioned, when {as yet there was} none of them. {all...: Heb. all of them} {which...: or, what days they should be fashioned}</v>
      <v n="17">How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</v>
      <v n="18">{If} I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</v>
      <v n="19">Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</v>
      <v n="20">For they speak against thee wickedly, {and} thine enemies take {thy name} in vain.</v>
      <v n="21">Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</v>
      <v n="22">I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</v>
      <v n="23">Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</v>
      <v n="24">And see if {there be any} wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. {wicked...: Heb. way of pain, or, grief}</v>
