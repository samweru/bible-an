      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David.] Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him {cometh} my salvation. {Truly: or, Only} {waiteth: Heb. is silent}</v>
      <v n="2">He only {is} my rock and my salvation; {he is} my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. {defence: Heb. high place}</v>
      <v n="3">How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall {shall ye be, and as} a tottering fence.</v>
      <v n="4">They only consult to cast {him} down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. {inwardly: Heb. in their inward parts}</v>
      <v n="5">My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation {is} from him.</v>
      <v n="6">He only {is} my rock and my salvation: {he is} my defence; I shall not be moved.</v>
      <v n="7">In God {is} my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, {and} my refuge, {is} in God.</v>
      <v n="8">Trust in him at all times; {ye} people, pour out your heart before him: God {is} a refuge for us. Selah.</v>
      <v n="9">Surely men of low degree {are} vanity, {and} men of high degree {are} a lie: to be laid in the balance, they {are} altogether {lighter} than vanity. {altogether: or, alike}</v>
      <v n="10">Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart {upon them}.</v>
      <v n="11">God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power {belongeth} unto God. {power: or, strength}</v>
      <v n="12">Also unto thee, O Lord, {belongeth} mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</v>
