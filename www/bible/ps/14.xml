      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David.] The fool hath said in his heart, {There is} no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, {there is} none that doeth good.</v>
      <v n="2">The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, {and} seek God.</v>
      <v n="3">They are all gone aside, they are {all} together become filthy: {there is} none that doeth good, no, not one. {filthy: Heb. stinking}</v>
      <v n="4">Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people {as} they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.</v>
      <v n="5">There were they in great fear: for God {is} in the generation of the righteous. {were...: Heb. they feared a fear}</v>
      <v n="6">Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD {is} his refuge.</v>
      <v n="7">Oh that the salvation of Israel {were come} out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, {and} Israel shall be glad. {Oh...: Heb. Who will give}</v>
