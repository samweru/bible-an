      <v n="1">[A Prayer of David.] Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I {am} poor and needy. {A Prayer...: or, A Prayer, being a Psalm of David}</v>
      <v n="2">Preserve my soul; for I {am} holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. {holy: or, one whom thou favourest}</v>
      <v n="3">Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily. {daily: or, all the day}</v>
      <v n="4">Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.</v>
      <v n="5">For thou, Lord, {art} good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</v>
      <v n="6">Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.</v>
      <v n="7">In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.</v>
      <v n="8">Among the gods {there is} none like unto thee, O Lord; neither {are there any works} like unto thy works.</v>
      <v n="9">All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.</v>
      <v n="10">For thou {art} great, and doest wondrous things: thou {art} God alone.</v>
      <v n="11">Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</v>
      <v n="12">I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.</v>
      <v n="13">For great {is} thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. {hell: or, grave}</v>
      <v n="14">O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent {men} have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. {violent: Heb. terrible}</v>
      <v n="15">But thou, O Lord, {art} a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.</v>
      <v n="16">O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.</v>
      <v n="17">Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see {it}, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.</v>
