      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</v>
      <v n="2">For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. {of the deceitful: Heb. of deceit} {are opened: Heb. have opened themselves}</v>
      <v n="3">They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</v>
      <v n="4">For my love they are my adversaries: but I {give myself unto} prayer.</v>
      <v n="5">And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</v>
      <v n="6">Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. {Satan: or, an adversary}</v>
      <v n="7">When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. {be condemned: Heb. go out guilty, or, wicked}</v>
      <v n="8">Let his days be few; {and} let another take his office. {office: or, charge}</v>
      <v n="9">Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</v>
      <v n="10">Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek {their bread} also out of their desolate places.</v>
      <v n="11">Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</v>
      <v n="12">Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</v>
      <v n="13">Let his posterity be cut off; {and} in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</v>
      <v n="14">Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</v>
      <v n="15">Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</v>
      <v n="16">Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</v>
      <v n="17">As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</v>
      <v n="18">As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. {into his bowels: Heb. within him}</v>
      <v n="19">Let it be unto him as the garment {which} covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</v>
      <v n="20">{Let} this {be} the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</v>
      <v n="21">But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy {is} good, deliver thou me.</v>
      <v n="22">For I {am} poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</v>
      <v n="23">I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</v>
      <v n="24">My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</v>
      <v n="25">I became also a reproach unto them: {when} they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</v>
      <v n="26">Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</v>
      <v n="27">That they may know that this {is} thy hand; {that} thou, LORD, hast done it.</v>
      <v n="28">Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</v>
      <v n="29">Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</v>
      <v n="30">I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</v>
      <v n="31">For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save {him} from those that condemn his soul. {those...: Heb. the judges of}</v>
