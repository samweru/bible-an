      <v n="1">Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise {him}, O ye servants of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="2">Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,</v>
      <v n="3">Praise the LORD; for the LORD {is} good: sing praises unto his name; for {it is} pleasant.</v>
      <v n="4">For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, {and} Israel for his peculiar treasure.</v>
      <v n="5">For I know that the LORD {is} great, and {that} our Lord {is} above all gods.</v>
      <v n="6">Whatsoever the LORD pleased, {that} did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</v>
      <v n="7">He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</v>
      <v n="8">Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. {both...: Heb. from man unto beast}</v>
      <v n="9">{Who} sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</v>
      <v n="10">Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</v>
      <v n="11">Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</v>
      <v n="12">And gave their land {for} an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</v>
      <v n="13">Thy name, O LORD, {endureth} for ever; {and} thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. {throughout...: Heb. to generation and generation}</v>
      <v n="14">For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</v>
      <v n="15">The idols of the heathen {are} silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</v>
      <v n="16">They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;</v>
      <v n="17">They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there {any} breath in their mouths.</v>
      <v n="18">They that make them are like unto them: {so is} every one that trusteth in them.</v>
      <v n="19">Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:</v>
      <v n="20">Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.</v>
      <v n="21">Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</v>
