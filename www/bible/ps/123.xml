      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees.] Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</v>
      <v n="2">Behold, as the eyes of servants {look} unto the hand of their masters, {and} as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes {wait} upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</v>
      <v n="3">Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</v>
      <v n="4">Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, {and} with the contempt of the proud.</v>
