      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.] As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. {Maschil...: or, A Psalm giving instruction of the sons, etc} {panteth: Heb. brayeth}</v>
      <v n="2">My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</v>
      <v n="3">My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where {is} thy God?</v>
      <v n="4">When I remember these {things}, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</v>
      <v n="5">Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and {why} art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him {for} the help of his countenance. {cast: Heb. bowed} {praise: or, give thanks} {for the...: or, his presence is salvation}</v>

      <v n="9">I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</v>
      <v n="10">{As} with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where {is} thy God? {sword: or, killing}</v>
      <v n="11">Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, {who is} the health of my countenance, and my God.</v>
