      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.] Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.</v>
      <v n="2">Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</v>
      <v n="3">My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct {my prayer} unto thee, and will look up.</v>
      <v n="4">For thou {art} not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</v>
      <v n="5">The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. {in...: Heb. before thine eyes}</v>
      <v n="6">Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. {bloody...: Heb. man of bloods and deceit}</v>
      <v n="7">But as for me, I will come {into} thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: {and} in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple. {thy holy...: Heb. the temple of thy holiness}</v>
      <v n="8">Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. {mine...: Heb. those which observe me}</v>
      <v n="9">For {there is} no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part {is} very wickedness; their throat {is} an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue. {faithfulness: or, stedfastness} {their mouth: Heb. his mouth, that is, the mouth of any of them} {very...: Heb. wickednesses}</v>
      <v n="10">Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. {Destroy...: or, Make them guilty} {by...: or, from their counsels}</v>
      <v n="11">But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. {defendest...: Heb. coverest over, or, protectest them}</v>
      <v n="12">For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as {with} a shield. {compass: Heb. crown}</v>
