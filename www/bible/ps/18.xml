      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, {A Psalm} of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,] I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</v>
      <v n="2">The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, {and} my high tower. {my strength: Heb. my rock}</v>
      <v n="3">I will call upon the LORD, {who is worthy} to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</v>
      <v n="4">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid. {ungodly men: Heb. Belial}</v>
      <v n="5">The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me. {sorrows: or, cords}</v>
      <v n="6">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, {even} into his ears.</v>
      <v n="7">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</v>
      <v n="8">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. {out of his nostrils: Heb. by his, etc}</v>
      <v n="9">He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness {was} under his feet.</v>
      <v n="10">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</v>
      <v n="11">He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him {were} dark waters {and} thick clouds of the skies.</v>
      <v n="12">At the brightness {that was} before him his thick clouds passed, hail {stones} and coals of fire.</v>
      <v n="13">The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail {stones} and coals of fire.</v>
      <v n="14">Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</v>
      <v n="15">Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</v>
      <v n="16">He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters. {many: or, great}</v>
      <v n="17">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</v>
      <v n="18">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</v>
      <v n="19">He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</v>
      <v n="20">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</v>
      <v n="21">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</v>
      <v n="22">For all his judgments {were} before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</v>
      <v n="23">I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. {before: Heb. with}</v>
      <v n="24">Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight. {in...: Heb. before his eyes}</v>
      <v n="25">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</v>
      <v n="26">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. {shew thyself froward: or, wrestle}</v>
      <v n="27">For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</v>
      <v n="28">For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness. {candle: or, lamp}</v>
      <v n="29">For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall. {run...: or, broken}</v>
      <v n="30">{As for} God, his way {is} perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he {is} a buckler to all those that trust in him. {tried: or, refined}</v>
      <v n="31">For who {is} God save the LORD? or who {is} a rock save our God?</v>
      <v n="32">{It is} God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</v>
      <v n="33">He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}, and setteth me upon my high places.</v>
      <v n="34">He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</v>
      <v n="35">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. {thy gentleness...: or, with thy meekness thou hast multiplied me}</v>
      <v n="36">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. {my feet: Heb. mine ankles}</v>
      <v n="37">I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</v>
      <v n="38">I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</v>
      <v n="39">For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. {subdued: Heb. caused to bow}</v>
      <v n="40">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</v>
      <v n="41">They cried, but {there was} none to save {them: even} unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</v>
      <v n="42">Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</v>
      <v n="43">Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; {and} thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people {whom} I have not known shall serve me.</v>
      <v n="44">As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. {As soon...: Heb. At the hearing of the ear} {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience} {strangers: Heb. sons of the stranger}</v>
      <v n="45">The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. {strangers: Heb. sons of the stranger}</v>
      <v n="46">The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</v>
      <v n="47">{It is} God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. {avengeth: Heb. giveth avengements for} {subdueth: or, destroyeth}</v>
      <v n="48">He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. {violent...: Heb. man of violence}</v>
      <v n="49">Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. {give...: or, confess}</v>
      <v n="50">Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</v>
