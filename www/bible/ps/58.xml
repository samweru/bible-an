      <v n="2">Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</v>
      <v n="3">The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies. {as soon...: Heb. from the belly}</v>
      <v n="4">Their poison {is} like the poison of a serpent: {they are} like the deaf adder {that} stoppeth her ear; {like the poison: Heb. according to the likeness, etc} {adder: or, asp}</v>
