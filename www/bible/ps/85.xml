      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.] LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. {for the sons: or, of the sons} {favourable: or, well pleased}</v>
      <v n="2">Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</v>
      <v n="3">Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned {thyself} from the fierceness of thine anger. {thyself...: or, thine anger from waxing hot}</v>
      <v n="4">Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</v>
      <v n="5">Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</v>
      <v n="6">Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?</v>
      <v n="7">Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.</v>
      <v n="8">I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</v>
      <v n="9">Surely his salvation {is} nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.</v>
      <v n="10">Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed {each other}.</v>
      <v n="11">Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</v>
      <v n="12">Yea, the LORD shall give {that which is} good; and our land shall yield her increase.</v>
      <v n="13">Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set {us} in the way of his steps.</v>
