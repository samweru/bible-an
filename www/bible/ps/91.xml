      <v n="1">He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. {abide: Heb. lodge}</v>
      <v n="2">I will say of the LORD, {He is} my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.</v>
      <v n="3">Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, {and} from the noisome pestilence.</v>
      <v n="4">He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth {shall be thy} shield and buckler.</v>
      <v n="5">Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; {nor} for the arrow {that} flieth by day;</v>
      <v n="6">{Nor} for the pestilence {that} walketh in darkness; {nor} for the destruction {that} wasteth at noonday.</v>

      <v n="14">Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</v>
      <v n="15">He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I {will be} with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</v>
      <v n="16">With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. {long...: Heb. length of days}</v>
