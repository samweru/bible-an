      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Jonathelemrechokim, Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.] Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me. {Michtam...: or, A golden Psalm of David}</v>
      <v n="2">Mine enemies would daily swallow {me} up: for {they be} many that fight against me, O thou most High. {enemies: Heb. observers}</v>
      <v n="3">What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</v>
      <v n="4">In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</v>
      <v n="5">Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts {are} against me for evil.</v>
      <v n="6">They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.</v>
      <v n="7">Shall they escape by iniquity? in {thine} anger cast down the people, O God.</v>
      <v n="8">Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: {are they} not in thy book?</v>
      <v n="9">When I cry {unto thee}, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God {is} for me.</v>
      <v n="10">In God will I praise {his} word: in the LORD will I praise {his} word.</v>
      <v n="11">In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</v>
      <v n="12">Thy vows {are} upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</v>
      <v n="13">For thou hast delivered my soul from death: {wilt} not {thou deliver} my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</v>
