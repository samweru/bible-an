      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, {A Psalm} of David.] Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto {my} soul.</v>
      <v n="2">I sink in deep mire, where {there is} no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me. {deep mire: Heb. the mire of depth} {deep waters: Heb. depth of waters}</v>
      <v n="3">I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</v>
      <v n="4">They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, {being} mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored {that} which I took not away.</v>
      <v n="5">O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee. {sins: Heb. guiltiness}</v>
      <v n="6">Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</v>
      <v n="7">Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</v>
      <v n="8">I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</v>
      <v n="9">For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</v>
      <v n="10">When I wept, {and chastened} my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</v>
      <v n="11">I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</v>
      <v n="12">They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I {was} the song of the drunkards. {drunkards: Heb. drinkers of strong drink}</v>
      <v n="13">But as for me, my prayer {is} unto thee, O LORD, {in} an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</v>
      <v n="14">Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</v>
      <v n="15">Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</v>
      <v n="16">Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness {is} good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</v>
      <v n="17">And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily. {hear...: Heb. make haste to hear me}</v>
      <v n="18">Draw nigh unto my soul, {and} redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</v>
      <v n="19">Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries {are} all before thee.</v>
      <v n="20">Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked {for some} to take pity, but {there was} none; and for comforters, but I found none. {to take...: Heb. to lament with me}</v>
      <v n="21">They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</v>
      <v n="22">Let their table become a snare before them: and {that which should have been} for {their} welfare, {let it become} a trap.</v>
      <v n="23">Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</v>
      <v n="24">Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</v>
      <v n="25">Let their habitation be desolate; {and} let none dwell in their tents. {their habitation: Heb. their palace} {let none...: Heb. let there not be a dweller}</v>
      <v n="26">For they persecute {him} whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. {those...: Heb. thy wounded}</v>
      <v n="27">Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness. {iniquity unto...: or, punishment of iniquity, etc}</v>
      <v n="28">Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</v>
      <v n="29">But I {am} poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</v>
      <v n="30">I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</v>
      <v n="31">{This} also shall please the LORD better than an ox {or} bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</v>
      <v n="32">The humble shall see {this, and} be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God. {humble: or, meek}</v>
      <v n="33">For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</v>
      <v n="34">Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. {moveth: Heb. creepeth}</v>
      <v n="35">For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</v>
      <v n="36">The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</v>
