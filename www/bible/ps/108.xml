      <v n="1">[A Song {or} Psalm of David.] O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</v>
      <v n="2">Awake, psaltery and harp: I {myself} will awake early.</v>
      <v n="3">I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</v>
      <v n="4">For thy mercy {is} great above the heavens: and thy truth {reacheth} unto the clouds. {clouds: or, skies}</v>
      <v n="5">Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;</v>
      <v n="6">That thy beloved may be delivered: save {with} thy right hand, and answer me.</v>
      <v n="7">God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</v>
      <v n="8">Gilead {is} mine; Manasseh {is} mine; Ephraim also {is} the strength of mine head; Judah {is} my lawgiver;</v>
      <v n="9">Moab {is} my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.</v>
      <v n="10">Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</v>
      <v n="11">{Wilt} not {thou}, O God, {who} hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</v>
      <v n="12">Give us help from trouble: for vain {is} the help of man.</v>
      <v n="13">Through God we shall do valiantly: for he {it is that} shall tread down our enemies.</v>
