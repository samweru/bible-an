      <v n="1">[A Psalm of David.] Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, {and} in thy righteousness.</v>
      <v n="2">And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</v>
      <v n="3">For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</v>
      <v n="4">Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</v>
      <v n="5">I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</v>
      <v n="6">I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul {thirsteth} after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</v>
      <v n="7">Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. {lest...: or, for I am become like, etc}</v>
      <v n="8">Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</v>
      <v n="9">Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me. {flee...: Heb. hide me with thee}</v>
      <v n="10">Teach me to do thy will; for thou {art} my God: thy spirit {is} good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</v>
      <v n="11">Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</v>
      <v n="12">And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I {am} thy servant.</v>
