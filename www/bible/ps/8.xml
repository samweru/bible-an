      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.] O LORD our Lord, how excellent {is} thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</v>
      <v n="2">Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. {ordained: Heb. founded}</v>
      <v n="3">When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</v>
      <v n="4">What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</v>
      <v n="5">For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</v>
      <v n="6">Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all {things} under his feet:</v>
      <v n="7">All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; {All...: Heb. Flocks and oxen all of them}</v>
      <v n="8">The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, {and whatsoever} passeth through the paths of the seas.</v>
      <v n="9">O LORD our Lord, how excellent {is} thy name in all the earth!</v>
