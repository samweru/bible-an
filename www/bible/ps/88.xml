      <v n="1">[A Song {or} Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.] O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day {and} night before thee: {for the sons: or, of the sons} {Maschil...: or, A Psalm of Heman the Ezrahite, giving instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;</v>
      <v n="3">For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</v>
      <v n="4">I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man {that hath} no strength:</v>
      <v n="5">Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand. {from: or, by}</v>
      <v n="6">Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</v>
      <v n="7">Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted {me} with all thy waves. Selah.</v>
      <v n="8">Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: {I am} shut up, and I cannot come forth.</v>
      <v n="9">Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</v>
      <v n="10">Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise {and} praise thee? Selah.</v>
      <v n="11">Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? {or} thy faithfulness in destruction?</v>
      <v n="12">Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</v>
      <v n="13">But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</v>
      <v n="14">LORD, why castest thou off my soul? {why} hidest thou thy face from me?</v>
      <v n="15">I {am} afflicted and ready to die from {my} youth up: {while} I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</v>
      <v n="16">Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</v>
      <v n="17">They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together. {daily: or, all the day}</v>
      <v n="18">Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, {and} mine acquaintance into darkness.</v>
