      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David, when he changed his behaviour before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.] I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise {shall} continually {be} in my mouth. {Abimelech: or, Achish}</v>
      <v n="2">My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear {thereof}, and be glad.</v>
      <v n="3">O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</v>
      <v n="4">I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</v>
      <v n="5">They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. {were lightened: or, they flowed unto him}</v>
      <v n="6">This poor man cried, and the LORD heard {him}, and saved him out of all his troubles.</v>
      <v n="7">The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</v>
      <v n="8">O taste and see that the LORD {is} good: blessed {is} the man {that} trusteth in him.</v>
      <v n="9">O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for {there is} no want to them that fear him.</v>
      <v n="10">The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good {thing}.</v>
      <v n="11">Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="12">What man {is he that} desireth life, {and} loveth {many} days, that he may see good?</v>
      <v n="13">Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</v>
      <v n="14">Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</v>
      <v n="15">The eyes of the LORD {are} upon the righteous, and his ears {are open} unto their cry.</v>
      <v n="16">The face of the LORD {is} against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</v>
      <v n="17">{The righteous} cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</v>
      <v n="18">The LORD {is} nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. {unto...: Heb. to the broken of heart} {of a contrite...: Heb. contrite of spirit}</v>
      <v n="19">Many {are} the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</v>
      <v n="20">He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</v>
      <v n="21">Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate. {desolate: or, guilty}</v>
      <v n="22">The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate. {desolate: or, guilty}</v>
