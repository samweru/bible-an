      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees.] Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: {Many...: or, Much}</v>

      <v n="3">The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</v>
      <v n="4">The LORD {is} righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</v>
      <v n="5">Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</v>
      <v n="6">Let them be as the grass {upon} the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</v>
      <v n="7">Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</v>
      <v n="8">Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD {be} upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.</v>
