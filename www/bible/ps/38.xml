      <v n="1">[A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.] O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</v>
      <v n="2">For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</v>
      <v n="3">{There is} no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither {is there any} rest in my bones because of my sin. {rest: Heb. peace, or, health}</v>
      <v n="4">For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</v>
      <v n="5">My wounds stink {and} are corrupt because of my foolishness.</v>
      <v n="6">I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. {troubled: Heb. wried}</v>
      <v n="7">For my loins are filled with a loathsome {disease}: and {there is} no soundness in my flesh.</v>
      <v n="8">I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</v>
      <v n="9">Lord, all my desire {is} before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</v>
      <v n="10">My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. {is gone...: Heb. is not with me}</v>
      <v n="11">My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off. {sore: Heb. stroke} {my kinsmen: or, my neighbours}</v>
      <v n="12">They also that seek after my life lay snares {for me}: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</v>
      <v n="13">But I, as a deaf {man}, heard not; and {I was} as a dumb man {that} openeth not his mouth.</v>
      <v n="14">Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth {are} no reproofs.</v>
      <v n="15">For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. {in...: or, thee do I wait for} {hear: or, answer}</v>
      <v n="16">For I said, {Hear me}, lest {otherwise} they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify {themselves} against me.</v>
      <v n="17">For I {am} ready to halt, and my sorrow {is} continually before me. {to halt: Heb. for halting}</v>
      <v n="18">For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</v>
      <v n="19">But mine enemies {are} lively, {and} they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. {are lively...: Heb. being living, are strong}</v>
      <v n="20">They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow {the thing that} good {is}.</v>
      <v n="21">Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</v>
      <v n="22">Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. {to...: Heb. for my help}</v>
