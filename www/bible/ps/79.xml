      <v n="1">[A Psalm of Asaph.] O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. {of: or, for}</v>
      <v n="2">The dead bodies of thy servants have they given {to be} meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</v>
      <v n="3">Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and {there was} none to bury {them}.</v>
      <v n="4">We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</v>
      <v n="5">How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</v>
      <v n="6">Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</v>
      <v n="7">For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</v>
      <v n="8">O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low. {former...: or, the iniquities of them that were before us}</v>
      <v n="9">Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.</v>
      <v n="10">Wherefore should the heathen say, Where {is} their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight {by} the revenging of the blood of thy servants {which is} shed. {revenging: Heb. vengeance}</v>
      <v n="11">Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die; {thy...: Heb. thine arm} {preserve...: Heb. reserve the children of death}</v>
      <v n="12">And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</v>
      <v n="13">So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations. {to all...: Heb. to generation and generation}</v>
