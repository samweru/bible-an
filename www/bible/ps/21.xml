      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.] The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</v>
      <v n="2">Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.</v>
      <v n="3">For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</v>
      <v n="4">He asked life of thee, {and} thou gavest {it} him, {even} length of days for ever and ever.</v>
      <v n="5">His glory {is} great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</v>
      <v n="6">For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. {made him most...: Heb. set him to be blessings} {made him exceeding...: Heb. make him glad with joy}</v>
      <v n="7">For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</v>
      <v n="8">Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</v>
      <v n="9">Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</v>
      <v n="10">Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</v>
      <v n="11">For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, {which} they are not able {to perform}.</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, {when} thou shalt make ready {thine arrows} upon thy strings against the face of them. {shalt thou...: or, thou shalt set them as a butt} {back: Heb. shoulder}</v>
      <v n="13">Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: {so} will we sing and praise thy power.</v>
