      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.] Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</v>
      <v n="2">Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</v>
      <v n="3">For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin {is} ever before me.</v>
      <v n="4">Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done {this} evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, {and} be clear when thou judgest.</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. {conceive...: Heb. warm me}</v>
      <v n="6">Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden {part} thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</v>
      <v n="7">Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</v>
      <v n="8">Make me to hear joy and gladness; {that} the bones {which} thou hast broken may rejoice.</v>
      <v n="9">Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</v>
      <v n="10">Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. {right: or, constant}</v>
      <v n="11">Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</v>
      <v n="12">Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me {with thy} free spirit.</v>
      <v n="13">{Then} will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</v>
      <v n="14">Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: {and} my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. {bloodguiltiness: Heb. bloods}</v>
      <v n="15">O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</v>
      <v n="16">For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give {it}: thou delightest not in burnt offering. {else...: or, that I should}</v>
      <v n="17">The sacrifices of God {are} a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</v>
      <v n="18">Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</v>
      <v n="19">Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</v>
