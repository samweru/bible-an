      <v n="1">O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. {God...: Heb. God of revenges} {shew...: Heb. shine forth}</v>
      <v n="2">Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</v>
      <v n="3">LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</v>
      <v n="4">{How long} shall they utter {and} speak hard things? {and} all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</v>
      <v n="5">They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.</v>
      <v n="6">They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</v>
      <v n="7">Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard {it}.</v>
      <v n="8">Understand, ye brutish among the people: and {ye} fools, when will ye be wise?</v>
      <v n="9">He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</v>
      <v n="10">He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, {shall not he know}?</v>
      <v n="11">The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they {are} vanity.</v>
      <v n="12">Blessed {is} the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;</v>
      <v n="13">That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</v>
      <v n="14">For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</v>
      <v n="15">But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it. {shall follow...: Heb. shall be after it}</v>
      <v n="16">Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? {or} who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</v>
      <v n="17">Unless the LORD {had been} my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. {almost: or, quickly}</v>
      <v n="18">When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.</v>
      <v n="19">In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</v>
      <v n="20">Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</v>
      <v n="21">They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</v>
      <v n="22">But the LORD is my defence; and my God {is} the rock of my refuge.</v>
      <v n="23">And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; {yea}, the LORD our God shall cut them off.</v>
