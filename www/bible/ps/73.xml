      <v n="1">[A Psalm of Asaph.] Truly God {is} good to Israel, {even} to such as are of a clean heart. {of: or, for} {Truly: or, Yet} {of...: Heb. clean of heart}</v>
      <v n="2">But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</v>
      <v n="3">For I was envious at the foolish, {when} I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</v>
      <v n="4">For {there are} no bands in their death: but their strength {is} firm. {firm: Heb. fat}</v>
      <v n="5">They {are} not in trouble {as other} men; neither are they plagued like {other} men. {in...: Heb. in the trouble of other men} {like: Heb. with}</v>
      <v n="6">Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them {as} a garment.</v>
      <v n="7">Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. {have...: Heb. pass the thoughts of the heart}</v>
      <v n="8">They are corrupt, and speak wickedly {concerning} oppression: they speak loftily.</v>
      <v n="9">They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</v>
      <v n="10">Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full {cup} are wrung out to them.</v>
      <v n="11">And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</v>
      <v n="12">Behold, these {are} the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase {in} riches.</v>
      <v n="13">Verily I have cleansed my heart {in} vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</v>
      <v n="14">For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning. {chastened: Heb. my chastisement was}</v>
      <v n="15">If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend {against} the generation of thy children.</v>
      <v n="16">When I thought to know this, it {was} too painful for me; {too...: Heb. labour in mine eyes}</v>
      <v n="17">Until I went into the sanctuary of God; {then} understood I their end.</v>
      <v n="18">Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</v>
      <v n="19">How are they {brought} into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</v>
      <v n="20">As a dream when {one} awaketh; {so}, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</v>
      <v n="21">Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</v>
      <v n="22">So foolish {was} I, and ignorant: I was {as} a beast before thee. {ignorant: Heb. I knew not} {before Heb. with}</v>
      <v n="23">Nevertheless I {am} continually with thee: thou hast holden {me} by my right hand.</v>
      <v n="24">Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me {to} glory.</v>
      <v n="25">Whom have I in heaven {but thee}? and {there is} none upon earth {that} I desire beside thee.</v>
      <v n="26">My flesh and my heart faileth: {but} God {is} the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. {strength: Heb. rock}</v>
      <v n="27">For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</v>
      <v n="28">But {it is} good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</v>
