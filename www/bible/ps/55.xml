      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, {A Psalm} of David.] Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication. {chief...: or, overseer} {Maschil: or, of instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</v>
      <v n="3">Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</v>
      <v n="4">My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</v>
      <v n="5">Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. {overwhelmed: Heb. covered}</v>
      <v n="6">And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! {for then} would I fly away, and be at rest.</v>
      <v n="7">Lo, {then} would I wander far off, {and} remain in the wilderness. Selah.</v>
      <v n="8">I would hasten my escape from the windy storm {and} tempest.</v>
      <v n="9">Destroy, O Lord, {and} divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</v>
      <v n="10">Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow {are} in the midst of it.</v>
      <v n="11">Wickedness {is} in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</v>
      <v n="12">For {it was} not an enemy {that} reproached me; then I could have borne {it}: neither {was it} he that hated me {that} did magnify {himself} against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</v>
      <v n="13">But {it was} thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. {mine equal: Heb. according to my rank}</v>
      <v n="14">We took sweet counsel together, {and} walked unto the house of God in company. {We...: Heb. Who sweetened counsel}</v>
      <v n="15">Let death seize upon them, {and} let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness {is} in their dwellings, {and} among them. {hell: or, the grave}</v>
      <v n="16">As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</v>
      <v n="17">Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</v>
      <v n="18">He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle {that was} against me: for there were many with me.</v>
      <v n="19">God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. {Because...: or, With whom also there be no changes, yet they}</v>
      <v n="20">He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. {broken: Heb. profaned}</v>
      <v n="21">{The words} of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war {was} in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet {were} they drawn swords.</v>
      <v n="22">Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. {burden: or, gift}</v>
      <v n="23">But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. {bloody...: Heb. men of bloods and deceit} {shall...: Heb. shall not half their days}</v>
