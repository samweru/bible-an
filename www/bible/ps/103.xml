      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David.] Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, {bless} his holy name.</v>
      <v n="2">Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</v>
      <v n="3">Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</v>
      <v n="4">Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</v>
      <v n="5">Who satisfieth thy mouth with good {things; so that} thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</v>
      <v n="6">The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</v>
      <v n="7">He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</v>
      <v n="8">The LORD {is} merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. {plentious...: Heb. great in mercy}</v>
      <v n="9">He will not always chide: neither will he keep {his anger} for ever.</v>
      <v n="10">He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</v>
      <v n="11">For as the heaven is high above the earth, {so} great is his mercy toward them that fear him. {as...: Heb. according to the height of the heaven}</v>
      <v n="12">As far as the east is from the west, {so} far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</v>
      <v n="13">Like as a father pitieth {his} children, {so} the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</v>
      <v n="14">For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we {are} dust.</v>
      <v n="15">{As for} man, his days {are} as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</v>
      <v n="16">For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. {it is...: Heb. it is not}</v>
      <v n="17">But the mercy of the LORD {is} from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</v>
      <v n="18">To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</v>
      <v n="19">The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</v>
      <v n="20">Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. {that excel...: Heb. mighty in strength}</v>
      <v n="21">Bless ye the LORD, all {ye} his hosts; {ye} ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</v>
      <v n="22">Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</v>
