      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah.] Hear this, all {ye} people; give ear, all {ye} inhabitants of the world: {for: or, of}</v>
      <v n="2">Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</v>
      <v n="3">My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart {shall be} of understanding.</v>
      <v n="4">I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</v>
      <v n="5">Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, {when} the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</v>
      <v n="6">They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</v>
      <v n="7">None {of them} can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</v>
      <v n="8">(For the redemption of their soul {is} precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</v>
      <v n="9">That he should still live for ever, {and} not see corruption.</v>
      <v n="10">For he seeth {that} wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</v>
      <v n="11">Their inward thought {is, that} their houses {shall continue} for ever, {and} their dwelling places to all generations; they call {their} lands after their own names. {all...: Heb. generation and generation}</v>
      <v n="12">Nevertheless man {being} in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts {that} perish.</v>
      <v n="13">This their way {is} their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah. {approve...: Heb. delight in their mouth}</v>
      <v n="14">Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling. {beauty: or, strength} {in the grave from...: or, the grave being an habitation to every one of them}</v>
      <v n="15">But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah. {power: Heb. hand} {the grave: or, hell}</v>
      <v n="16">Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</v>
      <v n="17">For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</v>
      <v n="18">Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and {men} will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself. {while...: Heb. in his life}</v>
      <v n="19">He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light. {He...: Heb. The soul shall}</v>
      <v n="20">Man {that is} in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts {that} perish.</v>
