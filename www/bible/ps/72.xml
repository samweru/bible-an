      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} for Solomon.] Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son. {for: or, of}</v>
      <v n="2">He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</v>
      <v n="3">The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</v>
      <v n="4">He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</v>
      <v n="5">They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</v>
      <v n="6">He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers {that} water the earth.</v>
      <v n="7">In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. {so long...: Heb. till there be no moon}</v>
      <v n="8">He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</v>
      <v n="9">They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</v>
      <v n="10">The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</v>
      <v n="11">Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</v>
      <v n="12">For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and {him} that hath no helper.</v>
      <v n="13">He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</v>
      <v n="14">He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</v>
      <v n="15">And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; {and} daily shall he be praised. {shall be given: Heb. one shall give}</v>
      <v n="16">There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and {they} of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</v>
      <v n="17">His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and {men} shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. {endure: Heb. be} {his name shall be...: Heb. shall be as a son to continue his father's name for ever}</v>
      <v n="18">Blessed {be} the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</v>
      <v n="19">And blessed {be} his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled {with} his glory; Amen, and Amen.</v>
      <v n="20">The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</v>
