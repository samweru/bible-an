      <v n="1">[A Song of degrees of David.] LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. {exercise...: Heb. walk} {high: Heb. wonderful}</v>
      <v n="2">Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul {is} even as a weaned child. {myself: Heb. my soul}</v>
      <v n="3">Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. {henceforth: Heb. now}</v>
