      <v n="1">[To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, Maschil.] We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, {what} work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. {Maschil: or, of instruction}</v>
      <v n="2">{How} thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; {how} thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</v>
      <v n="3">For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</v>
      <v n="5">Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</v>
      <v n="6">For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</v>
      <v n="7">But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</v>
      <v n="8">In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</v>
      <v n="9">But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</v>
      <v n="10">Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</v>
      <v n="11">Thou hast given us like sheep {appointed} for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen. {like...: Heb. as sheep of meat}</v>
      <v n="12">Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase {thy wealth} by their price. {for...: Heb. without riches}</v>
      <v n="13">Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</v>
      <v n="14">Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</v>
      <v n="15">My confusion {is} continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</v>
      <v n="16">For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</v>
      <v n="17">All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</v>
      <v n="18">Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; {steps: or, goings}</v>
      <v n="19">Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</v>
      <v n="20">If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</v>
      <v n="21">Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</v>
      <v n="22">Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</v>
      <v n="23">Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast {us} not off for ever.</v>
      <v n="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, {and} forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</v>
      <v n="25">For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</v>
      <v n="26">Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake. {for our...: Heb. a help for us}</v>
