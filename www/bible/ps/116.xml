      <v n="1">I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice {and} my supplications.</v>
      <v n="2">Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon {him} as long as I live. {as long...: Heb. in my days}</v>
      <v n="3">The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. {gat...: Heb. found me}</v>
      <v n="4">Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</v>
      <v n="5">Gracious {is} the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God {is} merciful.</v>
      <v n="6">The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</v>
      <v n="7">Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.</v>
      <v n="8">For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, {and} my feet from falling.</v>
      <v n="9">I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</v>
      <v n="10">I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</v>
      <v n="11">I said in my haste, All men {are} liars.</v>
      <v n="12">What shall I render unto the LORD {for} all his benefits toward me?</v>
      <v n="13">I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="14">I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.</v>
      <v n="15">Precious in the sight of the LORD {is} the death of his saints.</v>
      <v n="16">O LORD, truly I {am} thy servant; I {am} thy servant, {and} the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</v>
      <v n="17">I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="18">I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,</v>
      <v n="19">In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.</v>
