      <v n="1">Blessed {is} the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. {ungodly: or, wicked}</v>
      <v n="2">But his delight {is} in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</v>
      <v n="3">And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. {wither: Heb. fade}</v>
      <v n="4">The ungodly {are} not so: but {are} like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</v>
      <v n="5">Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</v>
      <v n="6">For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</v>
