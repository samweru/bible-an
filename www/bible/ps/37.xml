      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David.] Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</v>
      <v n="2">For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</v>
      <v n="3">Trust in the LORD, and do good; {so} shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. {verily: Heb. in truth, or, stableness}</v>
      <v n="4">Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</v>
      <v n="5">Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring {it} to pass. {Commit...: Heb. Roll thy way upon}</v>
      <v n="6">And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</v>
      <v n="7">Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. {Rest in: Heb. Be silent to}</v>
      <v n="8">Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</v>
      <v n="9">For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</v>
      <v n="10">For yet a little while, and the wicked {shall} not {be}: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it {shall} not {be}.</v>
      <v n="11">But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</v>
      <v n="12">The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. {plotteth: or, practiseth}</v>
      <v n="13">The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</v>
      <v n="14">The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, {and} to slay such as be of upright conversation. {such...: Heb. the upright of way}</v>
      <v n="15">Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</v>
      <v n="16">A little that a righteous man hath {is} better than the riches of many wicked.</v>
      <v n="17">For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</v>
      <v n="18">The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</v>
      <v n="19">They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</v>
      <v n="20">But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD {shall be} as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. {the fat: Heb. the preciousness}</v>
      <v n="21">The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</v>
      <v n="22">For {such as be} blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and {they that be} cursed of him shall be cut off.</v>
      <v n="23">The steps of a {good} man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. {ordered: or, established}</v>
      <v n="24">Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth {him with} his hand.</v>
      <v n="25">I have been young, and {now} am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</v>
      <v n="26">{He is} ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed {is} blessed. {ever: Heb. all the day}</v>
      <v n="27">Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</v>
      <v n="28">For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</v>
      <v n="29">The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</v>
      <v n="30">The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</v>
      <v n="31">The law of his God {is} in his heart; none of his steps shall slide. {steps: or, goings}</v>
      <v n="32">The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</v>
      <v n="33">The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</v>
      <v n="34">Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see {it}.</v>
      <v n="35">I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree. {a green...: or, a green tree that groweth in his own soil}</v>
      <v n="36">Yet he passed away, and, lo, he {was} not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</v>
      <v n="37">Mark the perfect {man}, and behold the upright: for the end of {that} man {is} peace.</v>
      <v n="38">But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</v>
      <v n="39">But the salvation of the righteous {is} of the LORD: {he is} their strength in the time of trouble.</v>
      <v n="40">And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</v>
