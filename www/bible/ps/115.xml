      <v n="1">Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, {and} for thy truth's sake.</v>
      <v n="2">Wherefore should the heathen say, Where {is} now their God?</v>
      <v n="3">But our God {is} in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</v>
      <v n="4">Their idols {are} silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</v>
      <v n="5">They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</v>
      <v n="6">They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</v>
      <v n="7">They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</v>
      <v n="8">They that make them are like unto them; {so is} every one that trusteth in them.</v>
      <v n="9">O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he {is} their help and their shield.</v>
      <v n="10">O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he {is} their help and their shield.</v>
      <v n="11">Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he {is} their help and their shield.</v>
      <v n="12">The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless {us}; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</v>
      <v n="13">He will bless them that fear the LORD, {both} small and great. {and: Heb. with}</v>
      <v n="14">The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</v>
      <v n="15">Ye {are} blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.</v>
      <v n="16">The heaven, {even} the heavens, {are} the LORD'S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</v>
      <v n="17">The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</v>
      <v n="18">But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.</v>
