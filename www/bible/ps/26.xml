      <v n="1">[{A Psalm} of David.] Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; {therefore} I shall not slide.</v>
      <v n="2">Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</v>
      <v n="3">For thy lovingkindness {is} before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</v>
      <v n="4">I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</v>
      <v n="5">I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</v>
      <v n="6">I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:</v>
      <v n="7">That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</v>
      <v n="8">LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth. {where...: Heb. of the tabernacle of thy honour}</v>
      <v n="9">Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: {Gather...: or, Take not away} {bloody...: Heb. men of blood}</v>
      <v n="10">In whose hands {is} mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. {full...: Heb. filled with}</v>
      <v n="11">But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</v>
      <v n="12">My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.</v>
