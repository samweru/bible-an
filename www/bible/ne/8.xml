      <v n="3">And he read therein before the street that {was} before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people {were attentive} unto the book of the law. {from...: Heb. from the light}</v>
      <v n="4">And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, {and} Meshullam. {pulpit...: Heb. tower of wood}</v>

      <v n="6">And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with {their} faces to the ground.</v>

      <v n="11">So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day {is} holy; neither be ye grieved.</v>

      <v n="17">And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</v>
