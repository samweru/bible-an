      <v n="1">Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</v>
      <v n="2">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</v>
      <v n="3">And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</v>
      <v n="4">Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</v>
      <v n="5">And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</v>
      <v n="6">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</v>
      <v n="7">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</v>
      <v n="8">He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</v>
      <v n="9">Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. {is born: or, has been born}</v>
      <v n="10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</v>
      <v n="11">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. {message: or, commandment}</v>
      <v n="12">Not as Cain, {who} was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</v>
      <v n="13">Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</v>
      <v n="14">We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not {his} brother abideth in death.</v>
      <v n="15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</v>
      <v n="16">Hereby perceive we the love {of God}, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down {our} lives for the brethren.</v>
      <v n="17">But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels {of compassion} from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</v>
      <v n="18">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</v>
      <v n="19">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. {assure: Gr. persuade}</v>
      <v n="20">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</v>
      <v n="21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, {then} have we confidence toward God.</v>
      <v n="22">And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</v>
      <v n="23">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</v>
      <v n="24">And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</v>
