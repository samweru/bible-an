      <v n="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</v>
      <v n="2">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. {among: or, by}</v>
      <v n="3">Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v n="4">No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of {this} life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</v>
      <v n="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, {yet} is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</v>
      <v n="6">The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. {that...: or, labouring first, must be partaker of the fruits}</v>
      <v n="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</v>
      <v n="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</v>
      <v n="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, {even} unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</v>
      <v n="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</v>
      <v n="11">{It is} a faithful saying: For if we be dead with {him}, we shall also live with {him}:</v>
      <v n="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with {him}: if we deny {him}, he also will deny us:</v>
      <v n="13">If we believe not, {yet} he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</v>
      <v n="14">Of these things put {them} in remembrance, charging {them} before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, {but} to the subverting of the hearers.</v>
      <v n="15">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</v>
      <v n="16">But shun profane {and} vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</v>
      <v n="17">And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; {canker: or, gangrene}</v>
      <v n="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</v>
      <v n="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. {sure: or, steady}</v>
      <v n="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</v>
      <v n="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, {and} prepared unto every good work.</v>
      <v n="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</v>
      <v n="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</v>
      <v n="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all {men}, apt to teach, patient, {patient: or, forbearing}</v>
      <v n="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</v>
      <v n="26">And {that} they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will. {recover...: Gr. awake} {taken...: Gr. taken alive}</v>
