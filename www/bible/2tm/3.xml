      <v n="1">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</v>
      <v n="2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</v>
      <v n="3">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, {false...: or, one who foments strife}</v>
      <v n="4">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</v>
      <v n="5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</v>
      <v n="6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</v>
      <v n="7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</v>
      <v n="8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. {reprobate: or, of no judgment}</v>
      <v n="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all {men}, as theirs also was.</v>
      <v n="10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, {fully...: or, been a diligent follower of}</v>
      <v n="11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of {them} all the Lord delivered me.</v>
      <v n="12">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</v>
      <v n="13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</v>
      <v n="14">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned {them};</v>
      <v n="15">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</v>
      <v n="16">All scripture {is} given by inspiration of God, and {is} profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</v>
      <v n="17">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works. {throughly...: or, perfected}</v>
