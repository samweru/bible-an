      <v n="34">In the time {when} thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.</v>
      <v n="35">All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in {their} countenance.</v>
      <v n="36">The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never {shalt be} any more. {a terror: Heb. terrors} {never...: Heb. shalt not be for ever}</v>
