      <v n="1">Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that {was} over against the separate place, and which {was} before the building toward the north.</v>
      <v n="2">Before the length of an hundred cubits {was} the north door, and the breadth {was} fifty cubits.</v>
      <v n="3">Over against the twenty {cubits} which {were} for the inner court, and over against the pavement which {was} for the utter court, {was} gallery against gallery in three {stories}.</v>
      <v n="4">And before the chambers {was} a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</v>
      <v n="5">Now the upper chambers {were} shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. {were higher...: or, did eat of these} {than the lower...: or, and the building consisted of the lower and the middlemost}</v>
      <v n="6">For they {were} in three {stories}, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore {the building} was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</v>
      <v n="7">And the wall that {was} without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof {was} fifty cubits.</v>
      <v n="8">For the length of the chambers that {were} in the utter court {was} fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple {were} an hundred cubits.</v>
      <v n="9">And from under these chambers {was} the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court. {from under: or, from the place} {the entry: or, he that brought me} {as...: or, as he came}</v>
      <v n="10">The chambers {were} in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.</v>
      <v n="11">And the way before them {was} like the appearance of the chambers which {were} toward the north, as long as they, {and} as broad as they: and all their goings out {were} both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.</v>
      <v n="12">And according to the doors of the chambers that {were} toward the south {was} a door in the head of the way, {even} the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</v>
      <v n="13">Then said he unto me, The north chambers {and} the south chambers, which {are} before the separate place, they {be} holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place {is} holy.</v>
      <v n="14">When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy {place} into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they {are} holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to {those things} which {are} for the people.</v>
      <v n="15">Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect {is} toward the east, and measured it round about.</v>
      <v n="16">He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. {side: Heb. wind}</v>
      <v n="17">He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</v>
      <v n="18">He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.</v>
      <v n="19">He turned about to the west side, {and} measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.</v>
      <v n="20">He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred {reeds} long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</v>
