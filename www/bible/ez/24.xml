      <v n="1">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, {even} of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</v>
      <v n="3">And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set {it} on, and also pour water into it:</v>
      <v n="4">Gather the pieces thereof into it, {even} every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill {it} with the choice bones.</v>
      <v n="5">Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, {and} make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein. {burn: or, heap}</v>
      <v n="6">Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum {is} therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</v>
      <v n="7">For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</v>
      <v n="8">That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</v>
      <v n="9">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</v>
      <v n="10">Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</v>
      <v n="11">Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and {that} the filthiness of it may be molten in it, {that} the scum of it may be consumed.</v>
      <v n="12">She hath wearied {herself} with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum {shall be} in the fire.</v>
      <v n="13">In thy filthiness {is} lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</v>
      <v n="14">I the LORD have spoken {it}: it shall come to pass, and I will do {it}; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</v>
      <v n="15">Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="16">Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. {run down: Heb. go}</v>
      <v n="17">Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not {thy} lips, and eat not the bread of men. {Forbear: Heb. Be silent} {lips: Heb. upper lip}</v>
      <v n="18">So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</v>
      <v n="19">And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these {things are} to us, that thou doest {so}?</v>
      <v n="20">Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="21">Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. {that...: Heb. the pity of your soul}</v>
      <v n="22">And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover {your} lips, nor eat the bread of men.</v>
      <v n="23">And your tires {shall be} upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</v>
      <v n="24">Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.</v>
      <v n="25">Also, thou son of man, {shall it} not {be} in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, {that...: Heb. the lifting up of their soul}</v>
      <v n="26">{That} he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause {thee} to hear {it} with {thine} ears?</v>
      <v n="27">In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.</v>
