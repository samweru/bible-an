      <v n="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</v>
      <v n="3">And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I {am} against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate. {most...: Heb. desolation and desolation}</v>
      <v n="4">I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD.</v>
      <v n="5">Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed {the blood of} the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time {that their} iniquity {had} an end: {perpetual...: or, hatred of old} {shed...: Heb. poured out the children} {force: Heb. hands}</v>
      <v n="6">Therefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</v>
      <v n="7">Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. {most...: Heb. desolation and desolation}</v>
      <v n="8">And I will fill his mountains with his slain {men}: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.</v>
      <v n="9">I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD.</v>
      <v n="10">Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there: {whereas...: or, though the LORD was there}</v>
      <v n="11">Therefore, {as} I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.</v>
      <v n="12">And thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD, {and that} I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. {to consume: Heb. to devour}</v>
      <v n="13">Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard {them}. {boasted: Heb. magnified}</v>
      <v n="14">Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.</v>
      <v n="15">As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, {even} all of it: and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.</v>
