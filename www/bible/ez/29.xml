      <v n="1">In the tenth year, in the tenth {month}, in the twelfth {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:</v>
      <v n="3">Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I {am} against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river {is} mine own, and I have made {it} for myself.</v>
      <v n="4">But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</v>
      <v n="5">And I will leave thee {thrown} into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. {open...: Heb. face of the field}</v>
      <v n="6">And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I {am} the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</v>
      <v n="7">When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.</v>
      <v n="8">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee.</v>
      <v n="9">And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD: because he hath said, The river {is} mine, and I have made {it}.</v>
      <v n="10">Behold, therefore I {am} against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste {and} desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. {utterly...: Heb. wastes of waste} {from...: or, from Migdol to Syene} {Syene: Heb. Seveneh}</v>
      <v n="11">No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</v>
      <v n="12">And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries {that are} desolate, and her cities among the cities {that are} laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</v>
      <v n="13">Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:</v>
      <v n="14">And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return {into} the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. {habitation: or, birth} {base: Heb. low}</v>
      <v n="15">It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.</v>
      <v n="16">And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth {their} iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I {am} the Lord GOD.</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first {month}, in the first {day} of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="18">Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head {was} made bald, and every shoulder {was} peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:</v>
      <v n="19">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. {take her spoil...: Heb. spoil her spoil, and prey her prey}</v>
      <v n="20">I have given him the land of Egypt {for} his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD. {for his...: or, for his hire}</v>
      <v n="21">In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I {am} the LORD.</v>
