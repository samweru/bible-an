      <v n="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop {thy word} toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</v>
      <v n="3">And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I {am} against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</v>
      <v n="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</v>
      <v n="5">That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</v>
      <v n="6">Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of {thy} loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</v>
      <v n="7">And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak {as} water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD. {shall be weak...: Heb. shall go into water}</v>
      <v n="8">Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</v>
      <v n="9">Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</v>
      <v n="10">It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, {as} every tree. {it contemneth...: or, it is the rod of my son, it despiseth every tree}</v>
      <v n="11">And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</v>
      <v n="12">Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it {shall be} upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon {thy} thigh. {terrors...: or, they are thrust down to the sword with my people}</v>
      <v n="13">Because {it is} a trial, and what if {the sword} contemn even the rod? it shall be no {more}, saith the Lord GOD. {Because...: or, When the trial hath been, what then? shall they not also belong to the despising rod?}</v>
      <v n="14">Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite {thine} hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it {is} the sword of the great {men that are} slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. {hands...: Heb. hand to hand}</v>
      <v n="15">I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that {their} heart may faint, and {their} ruins be multiplied: ah! {it is} made bright, {it is} wrapped up for the slaughter. {point: or, glittering, or, fear} {wrapped up: or, sharpened}</v>
      <v n="16">Go thee one way or other, {either} on the right hand, {or} on the left, whithersoever thy face {is} set. {or on...: Heb. set thyself, take the left hand}</v>
      <v n="17">I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said {it}.</v>
      <v n="18">The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</v>
      <v n="19">Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose {it} at the head of the way to the city.</v>
      <v n="20">Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.</v>
      <v n="21">For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made {his} arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. {parting of: Heb. mother of} {arrows: or, knives} {images: Heb. teraphim}</v>
      <v n="22">At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint {battering} rams against the gates, to cast a mount, {and} to build a fort. {captains: or, battering rams: Heb. rams}</v>
      <v n="23">And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken. {to them...: or, for the oaths made unto them}</v>
      <v n="24">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, {I say}, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.</v>
      <v n="25">And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity {shall have} an end,</v>
      <v n="26">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this {shall} not {be} the same: exalt {him that is} low, and abase {him that is} high.</v>
      <v n="27">I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no {more}, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it {him}. {I will overturn...: Heb. Perverted, perverted, perverted, will I make it}</v>
      <v n="28">And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword {is} drawn: for the slaughter {it is} furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</v>
      <v n="29">Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of {them that are} slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity {shall have} an end.</v>
      <v n="30">Shall I cause {it} to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. {Shall...: or, Cause it to return}</v>
      <v n="31">And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, {and} skilful to destroy. {brutish: or, burning}</v>
      <v n="32">Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no {more} remembered: for I the LORD have spoken {it}.</v>
