      <v n="1">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</v>
      <v n="2">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and {so} it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</v>
      <v n="3">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</v>
      <v n="4">And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. {How...: Heb. What was, etc}</v>
      <v n="5">And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</v>
      <v n="6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</v>
      <v n="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here {am} I. {Here...: Heb. Behold me}</v>
      <v n="8">And he said unto me, Who {art} thou? And I answered him, I {am} an Amalekite.</v>
      <v n="9">He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life {is} yet whole in me. {anguish...: or, my coat of mail (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth me, that my, etc}</v>
      <v n="10">So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that {was} upon his head, and the bracelet that {was} on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</v>
      <v n="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that {were} with him:</v>
      <v n="12">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</v>
      <v n="13">And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence {art} thou? And he answered, I {am} the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</v>
      <v n="14">And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?</v>
      <v n="15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, {and} fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</v>
      <v n="16">And David said unto him, Thy blood {be} upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</v>
      <v n="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</v>
      <v n="18">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah {the use of} the bow: behold, {it is} written in the book of Jasher.) {of Jasher: or, of the upright}</v>
      <v n="19">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</v>
      <v n="20">Tell {it} not in Gath, publish {it} not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</v>
      <v n="21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, {let there be} no dew, neither {let there be} rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, {as though he had} not {been} anointed with oil.</v>
      <v n="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</v>
      <v n="23">Saul and Jonathan {were} lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. {pleasant: or, sweet}</v>
      <v n="24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with {other} delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</v>
      <v n="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, {thou wast} slain in thine high places.</v>
      <v n="26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</v>
      <v n="27">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</v>
