      <v n="1">And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</v>
      <v n="2">And he said, The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</v>
      <v n="3">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: {he is} my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</v>
      <v n="4">I will call on the LORD, {who is} worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</v>
      <v n="5">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; {waves: or, pangs} {ungodly...: Heb. Belial}</v>
      <v n="6">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; {sorrows: or, cords}</v>
      <v n="7">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry {did enter} into his ears.</v>
      <v n="8">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</v>
      <v n="9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. {out of his nostrils: Heb. by, etc}</v>
      <v n="10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness {was} under his feet.</v>
      <v n="11">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</v>
      <v n="12">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, {and} thick clouds of the skies. {dark...: Heb. binding of waters}</v>
      <v n="13">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</v>
      <v n="14">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</v>
      <v n="15">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</v>
      <v n="16">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</v>
      <v n="17">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; {many: or, great}</v>
      <v n="18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, {and} from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</v>
      <v n="19">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</v>
      <v n="20">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</v>
      <v n="21">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</v>
      <v n="22">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</v>
      <v n="23">For all his judgments {were} before me: and {as for} his statutes, I did not depart from them.</v>
      <v n="24">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. {before: Heb. to}</v>
      <v n="25">Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. {in...: Heb. before his eyes}</v>
      <v n="26">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, {and} with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</v>
      <v n="27">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. {shew thyself unsavoury: or, wrestle}</v>
      <v n="28">And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes {are} upon the haughty, {that} thou mayest bring {them} down.</v>
      <v n="29">For thou {art} my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. {lamp: or, candle}</v>
      <v n="30">For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. {run: or, broken}</v>
      <v n="31">{As for} God, his way {is} perfect; the word of the LORD {is} tried: he {is} a buckler to all them that trust in him. {tried: or, refined}</v>
      <v n="32">For who {is} God, save the LORD? and who {is} a rock, save our God?</v>
      <v n="33">God {is} my strength {and} power: and he maketh my way perfect. {maketh: Heb. riddeth, or, looseth}</v>
      <v n="34">He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}: and setteth me upon my high places. {maketh: Heb. equalleth}</v>
      <v n="35">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. {to war: Heb. for the war}</v>
      <v n="36">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. {made...: Heb. multiplied me}</v>
      <v n="37">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. {feet: Heb. ankles}</v>
      <v n="38">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</v>
      <v n="39">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</v>
      <v n="40">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. {subdued: Heb. caused to bow}</v>
      <v n="41">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</v>
      <v n="42">They looked, but {there was} none to save; {even} unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</v>
      <v n="43">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, {and} did spread them abroad.</v>
      <v n="44">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me {to be} head of the heathen: a people {which} I knew not shall serve me.</v>
      <v n="45">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. {Strangers: Heb. Sons of the stranger} {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience: Heb. lie}</v>
      <v n="46">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</v>
      <v n="47">The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</v>
      <v n="48">It {is} God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, {avengeth: Heb. giveth avengement for}</v>
      <v n="49">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</v>
      <v n="50">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</v>
      <v n="51">{He is} the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</v>
