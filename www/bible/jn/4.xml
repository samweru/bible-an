      <v n="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</v>
      <v n="2">And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, {was} not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou {art} a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</v>
      <v n="3">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for {it is} better for me to die than to live.</v>
      <v n="4">Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? {Doest...: or, Art thou greatly angry?}</v>
      <v n="5">So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made {it} to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. {gourd: or, palmcrist: Heb. Kikajon} {was...: Heb. rejoiced with great joy}</v>
      <v n="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</v>
      <v n="8">And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, {It is} better for me to die than to live. {vehement: or, silent}</v>
      <v n="9">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, {even} unto death. {Doest...: or, Art thou greatly angry?} {I do well...: or, I am greatly angry}</v>
      <v n="10">Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: {had pity: or, spared} {came...: Heb. was the son of the night}</v>
      <v n="11">And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and {also} much cattle?</v>
