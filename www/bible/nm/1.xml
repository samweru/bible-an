      <v n="35">Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Manasseh, {were} thirty and two thousand and two hundred.</v>
      <v n="36">Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;</v>
      <v n="37">Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Benjamin, {were} thirty and five thousand and four hundred.</v>

      <v n="49">Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:</v>
      <v n="50">But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that {belong} to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</v>
      <v n="51">And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</v>
      <v n="52">And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.</v>
      <v n="53">But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.</v>
      <v n="54">And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</v>
