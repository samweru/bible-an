      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</v>
      <v n="3">And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men {were} heads of the children of Israel.</v>
      <v n="4">And these {were} their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</v>
      <v n="5">Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</v>
      <v n="6">Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</v>
      <v n="7">Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</v>
      <v n="8">Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. {Oshea: also called, Joshua}</v>
      <v n="9">Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</v>
      <v n="10">Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</v>
      <v n="11">Of the tribe of Joseph, {namely}, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</v>
      <v n="12">Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</v>
      <v n="13">Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</v>
      <v n="14">Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</v>
      <v n="15">Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</v>
      <v n="16">These {are} the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. {Oshea: also called Joshua} {Jehoshua: or, Joshua}</v>
      <v n="17">And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this {way} southward, and go up into the mountain:</v>
      <v n="18">And see the land, what it {is}; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they {be} strong or weak, few or many;</v>
      <v n="19">And what the land {is} that they dwell in, whether it {be} good or bad; and what cities {they be} that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;</v>
      <v n="20">And what the land {is}, whether it {be} fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time {was} the time of the firstripe grapes.</v>
      <v n="21">So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</v>
      <v n="22">And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, {were}. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</v>
      <v n="23">And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and {they brought} of the pomegranates, and of the figs. {brook: or, valley}</v>
      <v n="24">The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. {brook: or, valley} {Eshcol: that is, A cluster of grapes}</v>
      <v n="25">And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</v>
      <v n="26">And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</v>
      <v n="27">And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this {is} the fruit of it.</v>
      <v n="28">Nevertheless the people {be} strong that dwell in the land, and the cities {are} walled, {and} very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</v>
      <v n="29">The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</v>
      <v n="30">And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</v>
      <v n="31">But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they {are} stronger than we.</v>
      <v n="32">And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, {is} a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it {are} men of a great stature. {men...: Heb. men of statures}</v>
      <v n="33">And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, {which come} of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</v>
