      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of {their} fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.</v>
      <v n="3">And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod {shall be} for the head of the house of their fathers.</v>
      <v n="4">And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</v>
      <v n="5">And it shall come to pass, {that} the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</v>
      <v n="6">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, {even} twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron {was} among their rods. {a rod...: Heb. a rod for one prince, a rod for one prince}</v>
      <v n="7">And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</v>
      <v n="8">And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</v>
      <v n="10">And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. {rebels: Heb. children of rebellion}</v>
      <v n="11">And Moses did {so}: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</v>
      <v n="12">And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.</v>
      <v n="13">Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</v>
