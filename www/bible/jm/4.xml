      <v n="1">From whence {come} wars and fightings among you? {come they} not hence, {even} of your lusts that war in your members? {fightings: or, brawlings} {lusts: or, pleasures}</v>
      <v n="2">Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</v>
      <v n="3">Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume {it} upon your lusts. {lusts: or, pleasures}</v>
      <v n="4">Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</v>
      <v n="5">Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? {to envy: or, enviously?}</v>
      <v n="6">But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</v>
      <v n="7">Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</v>
      <v n="8">Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse {your} hands, {ye} sinners; and purify {your} hearts, {ye} double minded.</v>
      <v n="9">Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and {your} joy to heaviness.</v>
      <v n="10">Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</v>
      <v n="11">Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of {his} brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</v>
      <v n="12">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</v>
      <v n="13">Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</v>
      <v n="14">Whereas ye know not what {shall be} on the morrow. For what {is} your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. {It...: or, For it is}</v>
      <v n="15">For that ye {ought} to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</v>
      <v n="16">But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</v>
      <v n="17">Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth {it} not, to him it is sin.</v>
