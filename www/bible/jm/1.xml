      <v n="1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</v>
      <v n="2">My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; {temptations: or, trials}</v>
      <v n="3">Knowing {this}, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</v>
      <v n="4">But let patience have {her} perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</v>
      <v n="5">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all {men} liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</v>
      <v n="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</v>
      <v n="7">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</v>
      <v n="8">A double minded man {is} unstable in all his ways.</v>
      <v n="9">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: {rejoice: or, glory}</v>
      <v n="10">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</v>
      <v n="11">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</v>
      <v n="12">Blessed {is} the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</v>
      <v n="13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: {evil: or, evils}</v>
      <v n="14">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</v>
      <v n="15">Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</v>
      <v n="16">Do not err, my beloved brethren.</v>
      <v n="17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</v>
      <v n="18">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</v>
      <v n="19">Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</v>
      <v n="20">For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</v>
      <v n="21">Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</v>
      <v n="22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</v>
      <v n="23">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</v>
      <v n="24">For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</v>
      <v n="25">But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth {therein}, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. {deed: or, doing}</v>
      <v n="26">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion {is} vain.</v>
      <v n="27">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, {and} to keep himself unspotted from the world.</v>
