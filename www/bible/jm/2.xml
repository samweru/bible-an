      <v n="1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, {the Lord} of glory, with respect of persons.</v>
      <v n="2">For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; {assembly: Gr. synagogue}</v>
      <v n="3">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: {in...: or, well, or, seemly}</v>
      <v n="4">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</v>
      <v n="5">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? {of the: or, of that}</v>
      <v n="6">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</v>
      <v n="7">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? {blaspheme: or, revile, or, slander}</v>
      <v n="8">If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</v>
      <v n="9">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</v>
      <v n="10">For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one {point}, he is guilty of all.</v>
      <v n="11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. {he that: or, that law which}</v>
      <v n="12">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</v>
      <v n="13">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. {rejoiceth: or, glorieth}</v>
      <v n="14">What {doth it} profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</v>
      <v n="15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</v>
      <v n="16">And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be {ye} warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what {doth it} profit?</v>
      <v n="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. {alone: Gr. by itself}</v>
      <v n="18">Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. {without: some copies read, by}</v>
      <v n="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</v>
      <v n="20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</v>
      <v n="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</v>
      <v n="22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? {Seest...: or, Thou seest}</v>
      <v n="23">And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</v>
      <v n="24">Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</v>
      <v n="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent {them} out another way?</v>
      <v n="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. {spirit: or, breath}</v>
