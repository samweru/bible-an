      <v n="1">Woe to the bloody city! it {is} all full of lies {and} robbery; the prey departeth not; {bloody...: Heb. city of bloods}</v>
      <v n="2">The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</v>
      <v n="3">The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and {there is} a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and {there is} none end of {their} corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: {the bright...: Heb. the flame of the sword, and the lightning of the spear}</v>
      <v n="4">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, I {am} against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</v>
      <v n="6">And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</v>
      <v n="7">And it shall come to pass, {that} all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</v>
      <v n="8">Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, {that had} the waters round about it, whose rampart {was} the sea, {and} her wall {was} from the sea? {populous...: or, nourishing, etc: Heb. No Amon}</v>
      <v n="9">Ethiopia and Egypt {were} her strength, and {it was} infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. {thy helpers: Heb. in thy help}</v>
      <v n="10">Yet {was} she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</v>
      <v n="11">Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</v>
      <v n="12">All thy strong holds {shall be like} fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</v>
      <v n="13">Behold, thy people in the midst of thee {are} women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</v>
      <v n="14">Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</v>
      <v n="15">There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</v>
      <v n="16">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away. {spoileth: or, spreadeth himself}</v>
      <v n="17">Thy crowned {are} as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, {but} when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they {are}.</v>
      <v n="18">Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell {in the dust}: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth {them}. {nobles: or, valiant ones}</v>
      <v n="19">{There is} no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually? {healing: Heb. wrinkling}</v>
