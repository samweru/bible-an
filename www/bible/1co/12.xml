      <v n="1">Now concerning spiritual {gifts}, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</v>
      <v n="2">Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</v>
      <v n="3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and {that} no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. {accursed: or, anathema}</v>
      <v n="4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</v>
      <v n="5">And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. {administrations: or, ministries}</v>
      <v n="6">And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</v>
      <v n="7">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</v>
      <v n="8">For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</v>
      <v n="9">To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</v>
      <v n="10">To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another {divers} kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</v>
      <v n="11">But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</v>
      <v n="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also {is} Christ.</v>
      <v n="13">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether {we be} Jews or Gentiles, whether {we be} bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. {Gentiles: Gr. Greeks}</v>
      <v n="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</v>
      <v n="15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</v>
      <v n="16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</v>
      <v n="17">If the whole body {were} an eye, where {were} the hearing? If the whole {were} hearing, where {were} the smelling?</v>
      <v n="18">But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</v>
      <v n="19">And if they were all one member, where {were} the body?</v>
      <v n="20">But now {are they} many members, yet but one body.</v>
      <v n="21">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</v>
      <v n="22">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</v>
      <v n="23">And those {members} of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely {parts} have more abundant comeliness. {bestow: or, put on}</v>
      <v n="24">For our comely {parts} have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that {part} which lacked:</v>
      <v n="25">That there should be no schism in the body; but {that} the members should have the same care one for another. {schism: or, division}</v>
      <v n="26">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</v>
      <v n="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</v>
      <v n="28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. {diversities: or, kinds}</v>
      <v n="29">{Are} all apostles? {are} all prophets? {are} all teachers? {are} all workers of miracles? {workers...: or, powers?}</v>
      <v n="30">Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</v>
      <v n="31">But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</v>
