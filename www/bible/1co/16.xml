      <v n="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</v>
      <v n="2">Upon the first {day} of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as {God} hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</v>
      <v n="3">And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by {your} letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. {liberality: Gr. gift}</v>
      <v n="4">And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</v>
      <v n="5">Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</v>
      <v n="6">And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</v>
      <v n="7">For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</v>
      <v n="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</v>
      <v n="9">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and {there are} many adversaries.</v>
      <v n="10">Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also {do}.</v>
      <v n="11">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</v>
      <v n="12">As touching {our} brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</v>
      <v n="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</v>
      <v n="14">Let all your things be done with charity.</v>
      <v n="15">I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and {that} they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</v>
      <v n="16">That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with {us}, and laboureth.</v>
      <v n="17">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</v>
      <v n="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</v>
      <v n="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</v>
      <v n="20">All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</v>
      <v n="21">The salutation of {me} Paul with mine own hand.</v>
      <v n="22">If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</v>
      <v n="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with you.</v>
      <v n="24">My love {be} with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. «{The first epistle} to the Corinthians was written from Philippi by Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus and Timotheus.}»</v>
