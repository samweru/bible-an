      <v n="1">Be ye followers of me, even as I also {am} of Christ.</v>
      <v n="2">Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered {them} to you. {ordinances: or, traditions}</v>
      <v n="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman {is} the man; and the head of Christ {is} God.</v>
      <v n="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having {his} head covered, dishonoureth his head.</v>
      <v n="5">But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with {her} head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</v>
      <v n="6">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</v>
      <v n="7">For a man indeed ought not to cover {his} head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</v>
      <v n="8">For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</v>
      <v n="9">Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</v>
      <v n="10">For this cause ought the woman to have power on {her} head because of the angels. {power: that is a covering in sign that she is under the power of her husband}</v>
      <v n="11">Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</v>
      <v n="12">For as the woman {is} of the man, even so {is} the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</v>
      <v n="13">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</v>
      <v n="14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</v>
      <v n="15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for {her} hair is given her for a covering. {covering: or, veil}</v>
      <v n="16">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</v>
      <v n="17">Now in this that I declare {unto you} I praise {you} not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</v>
      <v n="18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. {divisions: or, schisms}</v>
      <v n="19">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. {heresies: or, sects}</v>
      <v n="20">When ye come together therefore into one place, {this} is not to eat the Lord's supper. {this...: or, ye cannot eat}</v>
      <v n="21">For in eating every one taketh before {other} his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</v>
      <v n="22">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise {you} not. {have not: or, are poor?}</v>
      <v n="23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the {same} night in which he was betrayed took bread:</v>
      <v n="24">And when he had given thanks, he brake {it}, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. {in...: or, for a remembrance}</v>
      <v n="25">After the same manner also {he took} the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink {it}, in remembrance of me.</v>
      <v n="26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come. {ye do...: or, shew ye}</v>
      <v n="27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink {this} cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</v>
      <v n="28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of {that} bread, and drink of {that} cup.</v>
      <v n="29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. {damnation: or, judgment}</v>
      <v n="30">For this cause many {are} weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</v>
      <v n="31">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</v>
      <v n="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</v>
      <v n="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</v>
      <v n="34">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. {condemnation: or, judgment}</v>
