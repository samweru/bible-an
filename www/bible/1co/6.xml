      <v n="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</v>
      <v n="2">Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</v>
      <v n="3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</v>
      <v n="4">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</v>
      <v n="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</v>
      <v n="6">But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</v>
      <v n="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather {suffer yourselves to} be defrauded?</v>
      <v n="8">Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that {your} brethren.</v>
      <v n="9">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</v>
      <v n="10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="11">And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</v>
      <v n="12">All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. {expedient: or, profitable}</v>
      <v n="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body {is} not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. {Meats: not flesh only, but food of any kind}</v>
      <v n="14">And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</v>
      <v n="15">Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make {them} the members of an harlot? God forbid.</v>
      <v n="16">What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</v>
      <v n="17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</v>
      <v n="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</v>
      <v n="19">What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost {which is} in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</v>
      <v n="20">For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</v>
