      <v n="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, {even} as unto babes in Christ.</v>
      <v n="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able {to bear it}, neither yet now are ye able.</v>
      <v n="3">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas {there is} among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? {divisions: or, factions} {as men: Gr. according to man?}</v>
      <v n="4">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I {am} of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</v>
      <v n="5">Who then is Paul, and who {is} Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</v>
      <v n="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</v>
      <v n="7">So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</v>
      <v n="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</v>
      <v n="9">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, {ye are} God's building. {husbandry: or, tillage}</v>
      <v n="10">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</v>
      <v n="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v n="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</v>
      <v n="13">Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. {it shall be: Gr. it is}</v>
      <v n="14">If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</v>
      <v n="15">If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</v>
      <v n="16">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and {that} the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</v>
      <v n="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which {temple} ye are. {defile: or, destroy}</v>
      <v n="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</v>
      <v n="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</v>
      <v n="20">And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</v>
      <v n="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</v>
      <v n="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</v>
      <v n="23">And ye are Christ's; and Christ {is} God's.</v>
