      <v n="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</v>
      <v n="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</v>
      <v n="3">I {am} my beloved's, and my beloved {is} mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou {art} beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as {an army} with banners.</v>
      <v n="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair {is} as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. {overcome...: or, puffed me up}</v>
      <v n="6">Thy teeth {are} as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and {there is} not one barren among them.</v>
      <v n="7">As a piece of a pomegranate {are} thy temples within thy locks.</v>
      <v n="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</v>
      <v n="9">My dove, my undefiled is {but} one; she {is} the {only} one of her mother, she {is} the choice {one} of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; {yea}, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</v>
      <v n="10">Who {is} she {that} looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, {and} terrible as {an army} with banners?</v>
      <v n="11">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, {and} to see whether the vine flourished, {and} the pomegranates budded.</v>
      <v n="12">Or ever I was aware, my soul made me {like} the chariots of Amminadib. {Or ever...: Heb. I knew not} {made...: or, set me on the chariots of my willing people}</v>
      <v n="13">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. {of...: or, of Mahanaim}</v>
