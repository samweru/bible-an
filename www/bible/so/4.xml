      <v n="1">Behold, thou {art} fair, my love; behold, thou {art} fair; thou {hast} doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair {is} as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. {that...: or, that eat of, etc}</v>
      <v n="2">Thy teeth {are} like a flock {of sheep that are even} shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none {is} barren among them.</v>
      <v n="3">Thy lips {are} like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech {is} comely: thy temples {are} like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</v>
      <v n="4">Thy neck {is} like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</v>
      <v n="5">Thy two breasts {are} like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</v>
      <v n="6">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. {break: Heb. breathe}</v>
      <v n="7">Thou {art} all fair, my love; {there is} no spot in thee.</v>
      <v n="8">Come with me from Lebanon, {my} spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</v>
      <v n="9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, {my} spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. {ravished: or, taken away}</v>
      <v n="10">How fair is thy love, my sister, {my} spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</v>
      <v n="11">Thy lips, O {my} spouse, drop {as} the honeycomb: honey and milk {are} under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments {is} like the smell of Lebanon.</v>
      <v n="12">A garden inclosed {is} my sister, {my} spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. {inclosed: Heb. barred} {shut up: Heb. barred}</v>
      <v n="13">Thy plants {are} an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, {camphire: or, cypress}</v>
      <v n="14">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</v>
      <v n="15">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</v>
      <v n="16">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, {that} the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</v>
