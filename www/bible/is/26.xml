      <v n="1">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will {God} appoint {for} walls and bulwarks.</v>
      <v n="2">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. {truth: Heb. truths}</v>
      <v n="3">Thou wilt keep {him} in perfect peace, {whose} mind {is} stayed {on thee}: because he trusteth in thee. {perfect...: Heb. peace, peace} {mind: or, thought, or, imagination}</v>
      <v n="4">Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH {is} everlasting strength: {everlasting...: Heb. the rock of ages}</v>
      <v n="5">For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, {even} to the ground; he bringeth it {even} to the dust.</v>
      <v n="6">The foot shall tread it down, {even} the feet of the poor, {and} the steps of the needy.</v>
      <v n="7">The way of the just {is} uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</v>
      <v n="8">Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of {our} soul {is} to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</v>
      <v n="9">With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments {are} in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</v>
      <v n="10">Let favour be shewed to the wicked, {yet} will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="11">LORD, {when} thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: {but} they shall see, and be ashamed for {their} envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them. {at...: or, toward thy people}</v>
      <v n="12">LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. {in us: or, for us}</v>
      <v n="13">O LORD our God, {other} lords beside thee have had dominion over us: {but} by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</v>
      <v n="14">{They are} dead, they shall not live; {they are} deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</v>
      <v n="15">Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed {it} far {unto} all the ends of the earth.</v>
      <v n="16">LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer {when} thy chastening {was} upon them. {prayer: Heb. secret speech}</v>
      <v n="17">Like as a woman with child, {that} draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, {and} crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.</v>
      <v n="18">We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</v>
      <v n="19">Thy dead {men} shall live, {together with} my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew {is as} the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</v>
      <v n="20">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</v>
      <v n="21">For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. {blood: Heb. bloods}</v>
