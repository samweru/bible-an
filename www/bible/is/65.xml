      <v n="1">I am sought of {them that} asked not {for me}; I am found of {them that} sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation {that} was not called by my name.</v>
      <v n="2">I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way {that was} not good, after their own thoughts;</v>
      <v n="3">A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; {upon...: Heb. upon bricks}</v>
      <v n="4">Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable {things is in} their vessels; {broth: or, pieces}</v>
      <v n="5">Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These {are} a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. {nose: or, anger}</v>
      <v n="6">Behold, {it is} written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</v>
      <v n="7">Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</v>
      <v n="8">Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and {one} saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing {is} in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</v>
      <v n="9">And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</v>
      <v n="10">And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</v>
      <v n="11">But ye {are} they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. {troop: or, Gad} {number: or, Meni, a pagan god}</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose {that} wherein I delighted not.</v>
      <v n="13">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</v>
      <v n="14">Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. {vexation: Heb. breaking}</v>
      <v n="15">And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</v>
      <v n="16">That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</v>
      <v n="17">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. {come...: Heb. come upon the heart}</v>
      <v n="18">But be ye glad and rejoice for ever {in that} which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</v>
      <v n="19">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</v>
      <v n="20">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner {being} an hundred years old shall be accursed.</v>
      <v n="21">And they shall build houses, and inhabit {them}; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</v>
      <v n="22">They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree {are} the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. {shall long...: Heb. shall make them continue long, or, shall wear out}</v>
      <v n="23">They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they {are} the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</v>
      <v n="24">And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</v>
      <v n="25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust {shall be} the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</v>
