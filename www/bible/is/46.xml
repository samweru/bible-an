      <v n="1">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages {were} heavy loaden; {they are} a burden to the weary {beast}.</v>
      <v n="2">They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. {themselves: Heb. their soul}</v>
      <v n="3">Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne {by me} from the belly, which are carried from the womb:</v>
      <v n="4">And {even} to {your} old age I {am} he; and {even} to hoar hairs will I carry {you}: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver {you}.</v>
      <v n="5">To whom will ye liken me, and make {me} equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</v>
      <v n="6">They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, {and} hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.</v>
      <v n="7">They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, {one} shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</v>
      <v n="8">Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring {it} again to mind, O ye transgressors.</v>
      <v n="9">Remember the former things of old: for I {am} God, and {there is} none else; {I am} God, and {there is} none like me,</v>
      <v n="10">Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times {the things} that are not {yet} done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:</v>
      <v n="11">Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken {it}, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed {it}, I will also do it. {that...: Heb. of my counsel}</v>
      <v n="12">Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that {are} far from righteousness:</v>
      <v n="13">I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</v>
