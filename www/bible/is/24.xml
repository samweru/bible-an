      <v n="1">Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. {turneth...: Heb. perverteth the face thereof}</v>
      <v n="2">And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. {priest: or, prince}</v>
      <v n="3">The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.</v>
      <v n="4">The earth mourneth {and} fadeth away, the world languisheth {and} fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. {the haughty...: Heb. the height of the people}</v>
      <v n="5">The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.</v>
      <v n="6">Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.</v>
      <v n="7">The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.</v>
      <v n="8">The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</v>
      <v n="9">They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</v>
      <v n="10">The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.</v>
      <v n="11">{There is} a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.</v>
      <v n="12">In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</v>
      <v n="13">When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, {there shall be} as the shaking of an olive tree, {and} as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.</v>
      <v n="14">They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</v>
      <v n="15">Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, {even} the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. {fires: or, valleys}</v>
      <v n="16">From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, {even} glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. {uttermost...: Heb. wing} {My leanness: Heb. Leanness to me, or, My secret to me}</v>
      <v n="17">Fear, and the pit, and the snare, {are} upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.</v>
      <v n="18">And it shall come to pass, {that} he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.</v>
      <v n="19">The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.</v>
      <v n="20">The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.</v>
      <v n="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, {that} the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones {that are} on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. {punish: Heb. visit upon}</v>
      <v n="22">And they shall be gathered together, {as} prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited. {as prisoners...: Heb. with the gathering of prisoners} {pit: or, dungeon} {visited: or, found wanting}</v>
      <v n="23">Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. {before...: or, there shall be glory before his ancients}</v>
