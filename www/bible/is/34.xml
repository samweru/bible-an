      <v n="1">Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. {all that...: Heb. the fulness thereof}</v>
      <v n="2">For the indignation of the LORD {is} upon all nations, and {his} fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.</v>
      <v n="3">Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</v>
      <v n="4">And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling {fig} from the fig tree.</v>
      <v n="5">For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</v>
      <v n="6">The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, {and} with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.</v>
      <v n="7">And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness. {unicorns: or, rhinocerots} {soaked: or, drunken}</v>
      <v n="8">For {it is} the day of the LORD'S vengeance, {and} the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.</v>
      <v n="9">And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</v>
      <v n="10">It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</v>
      <v n="11">But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness. {cormorant: or, pelican}</v>
      <v n="12">They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none {shall be} there, and all her princes shall be nothing.</v>
      <v n="13">And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, {and} a court for owls. {owls: or, ostriches: Heb. daughters of the owl}</v>
      <v n="14">The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. {The wild...desert: Heb. Ziim} {the wild...island: Heb. Ijim} {screech...: or, night monster}</v>
      <v n="15">There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.</v>
      <v n="16">Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.</v>
      <v n="17">And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</v>
