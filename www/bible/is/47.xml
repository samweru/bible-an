      <v n="1">Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: {there is} no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.</v>
      <v n="2">Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.</v>
      <v n="3">Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet {thee as} a man.</v>
      <v n="4">{As for} our redeemer, the LORD of hosts {is} his name, the Holy One of Israel.</v>
      <v n="5">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</v>
      <v n="6">I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.</v>
      <v n="7">And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: {so} that thou didst not lay these {things} to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.</v>
      <v n="8">Therefore hear now this, {thou that art} given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I {am}, and none else beside me; I shall not sit {as} a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</v>
      <v n="9">But these two {things} shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, {and} for the great abundance of thine enchantments.</v>
      <v n="10">For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I {am}, and none else beside me. {perverted...: or, caused thee to turn away}</v>
      <v n="11">Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, {which} thou shalt not know. {from...: Heb. the morning thereof} {put: Heb. expiate}</v>
      <v n="12">Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from {these things} that shall come upon thee. {astrologers: Heb. viewers of the heavens} {the monthly...: Heb. that give knowledge concerning the months}</v>
      <v n="14">Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: {there shall} not {be} a coal to warm at, {nor} fire to sit before it. {themselves: Heb. their souls}</v>
      <v n="15">Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, {even} thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.</v>
