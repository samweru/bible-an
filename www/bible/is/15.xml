      <v n="2">He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads {shall be} baldness, {and} every beard cut off.</v>
      <v n="3">In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly. {weeping...: Heb. descending into weeping, or, coming down with weeping}</v>
      <v n="4">And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard {even} unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.</v>
      <v n="5">My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives {shall flee} unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction. {his...: or, to the borders thereof, even to Zoar, as an heifer} {destruction: Heb. breaking}</v>
      <v n="6">For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing. {desolate: Heb. desolations}</v>

      <v n="9">For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. {more: Heb. additions}</v>
