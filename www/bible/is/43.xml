      <v n="1">But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called {thee} by thy name; thou {art} mine.</v>
      <v n="2">When thou passest through the waters, I {will be} with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</v>
      <v n="3">For I {am} the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt {for} thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</v>
      <v n="4">Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. {life: or, person}</v>
      <v n="5">Fear not: for I {am} with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</v>
      <v n="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</v>
      <v n="7">{Even} every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</v>
      <v n="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</v>
      <v n="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, {It is} truth.</v>
      <v n="10">Ye {are} my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I {am} he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. {no...: or, nothing formed of God}</v>
      <v n="11">I, {even} I, {am} the LORD; and beside me {there is} no saviour.</v>
      <v n="12">I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when {there was} no strange {god} among you: therefore ye {are} my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I {am} God.</v>
      <v n="13">Yea, before the day {was} I {am} he; and {there is} none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it? {let it: Heb. turn it back?}</v>
      <v n="14">Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry {is} in the ships. {nobles: Heb. bars}</v>
      <v n="15">I {am} the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</v>
      <v n="16">Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</v>
      <v n="17">Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.</v>
      <v n="18">Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</v>
      <v n="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, {and} rivers in the desert.</v>
      <v n="20">The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, {and} rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. {owls: or, ostriches: Heb. daughters of the owl}</v>
      <v n="21">This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</v>
      <v n="22">But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</v>
      <v n="23">Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. {small...: Heb. lambs, or, kids}</v>
      <v n="24">Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. {filled...: Heb. made me drunk, or, abundantly moistened}</v>
      <v n="25">I, {even} I, {am} he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</v>
      <v n="26">Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</v>
      <v n="27">Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. {teachers: Heb. interpreters}</v>
      <v n="28">Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. {princes...: or, holy princes}</v>
