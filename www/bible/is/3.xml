      <v n="1">For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</v>
      <v n="2">The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</v>
      <v n="3">The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. {the honourable...: Heb. a man eminent in countenance} {eloquent...: or, skilful of speech}</v>
      <v n="4">And I will give children {to be} their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</v>
      <v n="5">And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</v>
      <v n="6">When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, {saying}, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and {let} this ruin {be} under thy hand:</v>
      <v n="7">In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house {is} neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. {swear: Heb. lift up the hand} {healer: Heb. binder up}</v>
      <v n="8">For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings {are} against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</v>
      <v n="9">The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide {it} not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</v>
      <v n="10">Say ye to the righteous, that {it shall be} well {with him}: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</v>
      <v n="11">Woe unto the wicked! {it shall be} ill {with him}: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. {given...: Heb. done to him}</v>
      <v n="12">{As for} my people, children {are} their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause {thee} to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. {lead...: or, call thee blessed} {destroy: Heb. swallow up}</v>
      <v n="13">The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</v>
      <v n="14">The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor {is} in your houses. {eaten: or, burnt}</v>
      <v n="15">What mean ye {that} ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</v>
      <v n="16">Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing {as} they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: {wanton...: Heb. deceiving with their eyes} {mincing: or, tripping nicely}</v>
      <v n="17">Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. {discover: Heb. make naked}</v>
      <v n="18">In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of {their} tinkling ornaments {about their feet}, and {their} cauls, and {their} round tires like the moon, {cauls: or, networks}</v>
      <v n="19">The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, {chains: or, sweet balls} {mufflers: or, spangled ornaments}</v>
      <v n="20">The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, {tablets: Heb. houses of the soul}</v>
      <v n="21">The rings, and nose jewels,</v>
      <v n="22">The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,</v>
      <v n="23">The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</v>
      <v n="24">And it shall come to pass, {that} instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; {and} burning instead of beauty.</v>
      <v n="25">Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. {mighty: Heb. might}</v>
      <v n="26">And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she {being} desolate shall sit upon the ground. {desolate: or, emptied: Heb. cleansed}</v>
