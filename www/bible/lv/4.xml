      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</v>
      <v n="3">If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.</v>
      <v n="4">And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.</v>
      <v n="5">And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:</v>
      <v n="6">And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.</v>
      <v n="7">And the priest shall put {some} of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which {is} in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which {is at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</v>
      <v n="8">And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that {is} upon the inwards,</v>
      <v n="9">And the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} upon them, which {is} by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,</v>
      <v n="10">As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.</v>
      <v n="11">And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,</v>
      <v n="12">Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. {without...: Heb. to without the camp} {where...: Heb. at the pouring out of the ashes}</v>
      <v n="13">And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done {somewhat against} any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which should not be done, and are guilty;</v>
      <v n="14">When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.</v>
      <v n="15">And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.</v>
      <v n="16">And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:</v>
      <v n="17">And the priest shall dip his finger {in some} of the blood, and sprinkle {it} seven times before the LORD, {even} before the vail.</v>
      <v n="18">And he shall put {some} of the blood upon the horns of the altar which {is} before the LORD, that {is} in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which {is at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</v>
      <v n="19">And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn {it} upon the altar.</v>
      <v n="20">And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.</v>
      <v n="21">And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it {is} a sin offering for the congregation.</v>
      <v n="22">When a ruler hath sinned, and done {somewhat} through ignorance {against} any of the commandments of the LORD his God {concerning things} which should not be done, and is guilty;</v>
      <v n="23">Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:</v>
      <v n="24">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it {is} a sin offering.</v>
      <v n="25">And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.</v>
      <v n="26">And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</v>
      <v n="27">And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth {somewhat against} any of the commandments of the LORD {concerning things} which ought not to be done, and be guilty; {any one: Heb. any soul} {common...: Heb. people of the land}</v>
      <v n="28">Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.</v>
      <v n="29">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.</v>
      <v n="30">And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.</v>
      <v n="31">And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn {it} upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.</v>
      <v n="32">And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.</v>
      <v n="33">And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</v>
      <v n="34">And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:</v>
      <v n="35">And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</v>
