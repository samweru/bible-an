      <v n="1">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</v>
      <v n="2">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</v>
      <v n="3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</v>
      <v n="4">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</v>
      <v n="5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</v>
      <v n="6">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</v>
      <v n="7">Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</v>
      <v n="8">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</v>
      <v n="9">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</v>
      <v n="10">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have {it} more abundantly.</v>
      <v n="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</v>
      <v n="12">But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</v>
      <v n="13">The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</v>
      <v n="14">I am the good shepherd, and know my {sheep}, and am known of mine.</v>
      <v n="15">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</v>
      <v n="16">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, {and} one shepherd.</v>
      <v n="17">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</v>
      <v n="18">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</v>
      <v n="19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</v>
      <v n="20">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</v>
      <v n="21">Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</v>
      <v n="22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</v>
      <v n="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</v>
      <v n="24">Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. {make...: or, hold us in suspense}</v>
      <v n="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</v>
      <v n="26">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</v>
      <v n="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</v>
      <v n="28">And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any {man} pluck them out of my hand.</v>
      <v n="29">My Father, which gave {them} me, is greater than all; and no {man} is able to pluck {them} out of my Father's hand.</v>
      <v n="30">I and {my} Father are one.</v>
      <v n="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</v>
      <v n="32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</v>
      <v n="33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</v>
      <v n="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</v>
      <v n="35">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</v>
      <v n="36">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</v>
      <v n="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</v>
      <v n="38">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father {is} in me, and I in him.</v>
      <v n="39">Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</v>
      <v n="40">And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</v>
      <v n="41">And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.</v>
      <v n="42">And many believed on him there.</v>
