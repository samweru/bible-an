      <v n="1">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</v>
      <v n="2">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every {branch} that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</v>
      <v n="3">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</v>
      <v n="4">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</v>
      <v n="5">I am the vine, ye {are} the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. {without me: or, severed from me}</v>
      <v n="6">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast {them} into the fire, and they are burned.</v>
      <v n="7">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</v>
      <v n="8">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</v>
      <v n="9">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</v>
      <v n="10">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</v>
      <v n="11">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and {that} your joy might be full.</v>
      <v n="12">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</v>
      <v n="13">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</v>
      <v n="14">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</v>
      <v n="15">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</v>
      <v n="16">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and {that} your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</v>
      <v n="17">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</v>
      <v n="18">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before {it hated} you.</v>
      <v n="19">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</v>
      <v n="20">Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</v>
      <v n="21">But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</v>
      <v n="22">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. {cloke: or, excuse}</v>
      <v n="23">He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</v>
      <v n="24">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</v>
      <v n="25">But {this cometh to pass}, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</v>
      <v n="26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, {even} the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</v>
      <v n="27">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</v>
