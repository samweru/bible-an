      <v n="1">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</v>
      <v n="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</v>
      <v n="3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</v>
      <v n="4">They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</v>
      <v n="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</v>
      <v n="6">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with {his} finger wrote on the ground, {as though he heard them not}.</v>
      <v n="7">So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</v>
      <v n="8">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</v>
      <v n="9">And they which heard {it}, being convicted by {their own} conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, {even} unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</v>
      <v n="10">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</v>
      <v n="11">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</v>
      <v n="12">Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</v>
      <v n="13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</v>
      <v n="14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, {yet} my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</v>
      <v n="15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</v>
      <v n="16">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</v>
      <v n="17">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</v>
      <v n="18">I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</v>
      <v n="19">Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</v>
      <v n="20">These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</v>
      <v n="21">Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</v>
      <v n="22">Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</v>
      <v n="23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</v>
      <v n="24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am {he}, ye shall die in your sins.</v>
      <v n="25">Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even {the same} that I said unto you from the beginning.</v>
      <v n="26">I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</v>
      <v n="27">They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</v>
      <v n="28">Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am {he}, and {that} I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</v>
      <v n="29">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</v>
      <v n="30">As he spake these words, many believed on him.</v>
      <v n="31">Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, {then} are ye my disciples indeed;</v>
      <v n="32">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</v>
      <v n="33">They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</v>
      <v n="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</v>
      <v n="35">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: {but} the Son abideth ever.</v>
      <v n="36">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</v>
      <v n="37">I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</v>
      <v n="38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</v>
      <v n="39">They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</v>
      <v n="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</v>
      <v n="41">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, {even} God.</v>
      <v n="42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</v>
      <v n="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? {even} because ye cannot hear my word.</v>
      <v n="44">Ye are of {your} father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. {of his own: or, from his own will or disposition}</v>
      <v n="45">And because I tell {you} the truth, ye believe me not.</v>
      <v n="46">Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</v>
      <v n="47">He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear {them} not, because ye are not of God.</v>
      <v n="48">Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</v>
      <v n="49">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</v>
      <v n="50">And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</v>
      <v n="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</v>
      <v n="52">Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</v>
      <v n="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</v>
      <v n="54">Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</v>
      <v n="55">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</v>
      <v n="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw {it}, and was glad.</v>
      <v n="57">Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</v>
      <v n="58">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</v>
      <v n="59">Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</v>
