      <v n="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</v>
      <v n="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</v>
      <v n="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. {again: or, from above}</v>
      <v n="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?</v>
      <v n="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and {of} the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</v>
      <v n="7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. {again: or, from above}</v>
      <v n="8">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</v>
      <v n="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</v>
      <v n="10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</v>
      <v n="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</v>
      <v n="12">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you {of} heavenly things?</v>
      <v n="13">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, {even} the Son of man which is in heaven.</v>
      <v n="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</v>
      <v n="15">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</v>
      <v n="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</v>
      <v n="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</v>
      <v n="18">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</v>
      <v n="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</v>
      <v n="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. {reproved: or, discovered}</v>
      <v n="21">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</v>
      <v n="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</v>
      <v n="23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</v>
      <v n="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</v>
      <v n="25">Then there arose a question between {some} of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.</v>
      <v n="26">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all {men} come to him.</v>
      <v n="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. {receive: or, take unto himself}</v>
      <v n="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</v>
      <v n="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</v>
      <v n="30">He must increase, but I {must} decrease.</v>
      <v n="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</v>
      <v n="32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</v>
      <v n="33">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</v>
      <v n="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure {unto him}.</v>
      <v n="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</v>
      <v n="36">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</v>
