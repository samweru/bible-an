      <v n="1">If {there be} therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</v>
      <v n="2">Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, {being} of one accord, of one mind.</v>
      <v n="3">{Let} nothing {be done} through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</v>
      <v n="4">Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</v>
      <v n="5">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</v>
      <v n="6">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</v>
      <v n="7">But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</v>
      <v n="8">And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. {fashion: or habit}</v>
      <v n="9">Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</v>
      <v n="10">That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of {things} in heaven, and {things} in earth, and {things} under the earth;</v>
      <v n="11">And {that} every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ {is} Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</v>
      <v n="12">Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</v>
      <v n="13">For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of {his} good pleasure.</v>
      <v n="14">Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</v>
      <v n="15">That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; {harmless: or, sincere} {ye shine: or, shine ye}</v>
      <v n="16">Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</v>
      <v n="17">Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. {offered: Gr. poured forth}</v>
      <v n="18">For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</v>
      <v n="19">But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. {But: or, Moreover}</v>
      <v n="20">For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. {likeminded: or, so dear unto me}</v>
      <v n="21">For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</v>
      <v n="22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</v>
      <v n="23">Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</v>
      <v n="24">But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</v>
      <v n="25">Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</v>
      <v n="26">For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</v>
      <v n="27">For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</v>
      <v n="28">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. {carefully: or, with more anxious care}</v>
      <v n="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: {hold...: or, honour such}</v>
      <v n="30">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</v>
