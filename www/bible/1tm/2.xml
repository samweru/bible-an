      <v n="1">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, {and} giving of thanks, be made for all men; {exhort: or, desire}</v>
      <v n="2">For kings, and {for} all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. {authority: or, eminent place}</v>
      <v n="3">For this {is} good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</v>
      <v n="4">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</v>
      <v n="5">For {there is} one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</v>
      <v n="6">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. {to...: or, a testimony}</v>
      <v n="7">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, {and} lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</v>
      <v n="8">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</v>
      <v n="9">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; {broided: or, plaited}</v>
      <v n="10">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</v>
      <v n="11">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</v>
      <v n="12">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</v>
      <v n="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</v>
      <v n="14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</v>
      <v n="15">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</v>
