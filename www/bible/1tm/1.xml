      <v n="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, {which is} our hope;</v>
      <v n="2">Unto Timothy, {my} own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, {and} peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</v>
      <v n="3">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</v>
      <v n="4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: {so do}.</v>
      <v n="5">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and {of} a good conscience, and {of} faith unfeigned:</v>
      <v n="6">From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; {having...: or, not aiming at}</v>
      <v n="7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</v>
      <v n="8">But we know that the law {is} good, if a man use it lawfully;</v>
      <v n="9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</v>
      <v n="10">For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</v>
      <v n="11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</v>
      <v n="12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</v>
      <v n="13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did {it} ignorantly in unbelief.</v>
      <v n="14">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</v>
      <v n="15">This {is} a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</v>
      <v n="16">Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</v>
      <v n="17">Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, {be} honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</v>
      <v n="18">This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</v>
      <v n="19">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</v>
      <v n="20">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</v>
