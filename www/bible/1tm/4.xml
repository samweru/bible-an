      <v n="1">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</v>
      <v n="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</v>
      <v n="3">Forbidding to marry, {and commanding} to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</v>
      <v n="4">For every creature of God {is} good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</v>
      <v n="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</v>
      <v n="6">If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</v>
      <v n="7">But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself {rather} unto godliness.</v>
      <v n="8">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. {little: or, for a little time}</v>
      <v n="9">This {is} a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</v>
      <v n="10">For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</v>
      <v n="11">These things command and teach.</v>
      <v n="12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</v>
      <v n="13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</v>
      <v n="14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</v>
      <v n="15">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. {to all: or, in all things}</v>
      <v n="16">Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</v>
