      <v n="1">Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah.</v>
      <v n="2">And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</v>
      <v n="3">And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</v>
      <v n="4">And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these {were} the children of Keturah.</v>
      <v n="5">And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</v>
      <v n="6">But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</v>
      <v n="7">And these {are} the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</v>
      <v n="8">Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}; and was gathered to his people.</v>
      <v n="9">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {is} before Mamre;</v>
      <v n="10">The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</v>
      <v n="11">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</v>
      <v n="12">Now these {are} the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</v>
      <v n="13">And these {are} the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</v>
      <v n="14">And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</v>
      <v n="15">Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: {Hadar: or, Hadad}</v>
      <v n="16">These {are} the sons of Ishmael, and these {are} their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</v>
      <v n="17">And these {are} the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.</v>
      <v n="18">And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that {is} before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: {and} he died in the presence of all his brethren. {died: Heb. fell}</v>
      <v n="19">And these {are} the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:</v>
      <v n="20">And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</v>
      <v n="21">And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she {was} barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</v>
      <v n="22">And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If {it be} so, why {am} I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="23">And the LORD said unto her, Two nations {are} in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and {the one} people shall be stronger than {the other} people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</v>
      <v n="24">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, {there were} twins in her womb.</v>
      <v n="25">And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</v>
      <v n="26">And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac {was} threescore years old when she bare them.</v>
      <v n="27">And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob {was} a plain man, dwelling in tents.</v>
      <v n="28">And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of {his} venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. {he...: Heb. venison was in his mouth}</v>
      <v n="29">And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he {was} faint:</v>
      <v n="30">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}; for I {am} faint: therefore was his name called Edom. {with...: Heb. with that red, with that red pottage} {Edom: that is Red}</v>
      <v n="31">And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</v>
      <v n="32">And Esau said, Behold, I {am} at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? {at...: Heb. going to die}</v>
      <v n="33">And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</v>
      <v n="34">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised {his} birthright.</v>
