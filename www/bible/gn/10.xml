      <v n="1">Now these {are} the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</v>
      <v n="2">The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</v>
      <v n="3">And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</v>
      <v n="4">And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. {Dodanim: or, as some read it, Rodanim}</v>
      <v n="5">By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</v>
      <v n="6">And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</v>
      <v n="7">And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</v>
      <v n="8">And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</v>
      <v n="9">He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</v>
      <v n="10">And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. {Babel: Gr. Babylon}</v>
      <v n="11">Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, {went...: or, he went out into Assyria} {the city...: or, the streets of the city}</v>
      <v n="12">And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same {is} a great city.</v>
      <v n="13">And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</v>
      <v n="14">And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.</v>
      <v n="15">And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, {Sidon: Heb. Tzidon}</v>
      <v n="16">And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</v>
      <v n="17">And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</v>
      <v n="18">And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</v>
      <v n="19">And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. {Gaza: Heb. Azzah}</v>
      <v n="20">These {are} the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, {and} in their nations.</v>
      <v n="21">Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were {children} born.</v>
      <v n="22">The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. {Arphaxad: Heb. Arpachshad}</v>
      <v n="23">And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</v>
      <v n="24">And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. {Salah: Heb. Shelah}</v>
      <v n="25">And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one {was} Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name {was} Joktan. {Peleg: that is Division}</v>
      <v n="26">And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,</v>
      <v n="27">And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,</v>
      <v n="28">And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</v>
      <v n="29">And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these {were} the sons of Joktan.</v>
      <v n="30">And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.</v>
      <v n="31">These {are} the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</v>
      <v n="32">These {are} the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</v>
