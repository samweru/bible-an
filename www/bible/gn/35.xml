      <v n="1">And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</v>
      <v n="2">Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that {were} with him, Put away the strange gods that {are} among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</v>
      <v n="3">And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</v>
      <v n="4">And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which {were} in their hand, and {all their} earrings which {were} in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which {was} by Shechem.</v>
      <v n="5">And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that {were} round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</v>
      <v n="6">So Jacob came to Luz, which {is} in the land of Canaan, that {is}, Bethel, he and all the people that {were} with him.</v>
      <v n="7">And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. {Elbethel: that is, The God of Bethel}</v>
      <v n="8">But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. {Allonbachuth: that is, The oak of weeping}</v>
      <v n="9">And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.</v>
      <v n="10">And God said unto him, Thy name {is} Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</v>
      <v n="11">And God said unto him, I {am} God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</v>
      <v n="12">And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</v>
      <v n="13">And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</v>
      <v n="14">And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, {even} a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</v>
      <v n="15">And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</v>
      <v n="16">And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. {a little...: Heb. a little piece of ground}</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</v>
      <v n="18">And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. {Benoni: that is, The son of my sorrow} {Benjamin: that is, The son of the right hand}</v>
      <v n="19">And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which {is} Bethlehem.</v>
      <v n="20">And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that {is} the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.</v>
      <v n="21">And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</v>
      <v n="22">And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard {it}. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</v>
      <v n="23">The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</v>
      <v n="24">The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</v>
      <v n="25">And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</v>
      <v n="26">And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these {are} the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</v>
      <v n="27">And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which {is} Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</v>
      <v n="28">And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</v>
      <v n="29">And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, {being} old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</v>
