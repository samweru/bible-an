      <v n="1">And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you {that} which shall befall you in the last days.</v>
      <v n="2">Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</v>
      <v n="3">Reuben, thou {art} my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</v>
      <v n="4">Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou {it}: he went up to my couch. {thou shalt...: Heb. do not thou excel} {he went...: or, my couch is gone}</v>
      <v n="5">Simeon and Levi {are} brethren; instruments of cruelty {are in} their habitations. {instruments...: or, their swords are weapons of violence}</v>
      <v n="6">O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. {digged...: or, houghed oxen}</v>
      <v n="7">Cursed {be} their anger, for {it was} fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</v>
      <v n="8">Judah, thou {art he} whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand {shall be} in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</v>
      <v n="9">Judah {is} a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</v>
      <v n="10">The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him {shall} the gathering of the people {be}.</v>
      <v n="11">Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</v>
      <v n="12">His eyes {shall be} red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</v>
      <v n="13">Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he {shall be} for an haven of ships; and his border {shall be} unto Zidon.</v>
      <v n="14">Issachar {is} a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</v>
      <v n="15">And he saw that rest {was} good, and the land that {it was} pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</v>
      <v n="16">Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</v>
      <v n="17">Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. {an adder: Heb. an arrow-snake}</v>
      <v n="18">I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</v>
      <v n="19">Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</v>
      <v n="20">Out of Asher his bread {shall be} fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</v>
      <v n="21">Naphtali {is} a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</v>
      <v n="22">Joseph {is} a fruitful bough, {even} a fruitful bough by a well; {whose} branches run over the wall: {branches: Heb. daughters}</v>
      <v n="23">The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot {at him}, and hated him:</v>
      <v n="24">But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty {God} of Jacob; (from thence {is} the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</v>
      <v n="25">{Even} by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</v>
      <v n="26">The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</v>
      <v n="27">Benjamin shall ravin {as} a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</v>
      <v n="28">All these {are} the twelve tribes of Israel: and this {is it} that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</v>
      <v n="29">And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that {is} in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</v>
      <v n="30">In the cave that {is} in the field of Machpelah, which {is} before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</v>
      <v n="31">There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</v>
      <v n="32">The purchase of the field and of the cave that {is} therein {was} from the children of Heth.</v>
      <v n="33">And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</v>
