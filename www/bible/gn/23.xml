      <v n="2">And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</v>
      <v n="3">And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,</v>
      <v n="4">I {am} a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</v>
      <v n="5">And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</v>
      <v n="6">Hear us, my lord: thou {art} a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. {a mighty...: Heb. a prince of God}</v>
      <v n="7">And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, {even} to the children of Heth.</v>
      <v n="8">And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</v>
      <v n="9">That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which {is} in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. {as much...: Heb. full money}</v>
      <v n="10">And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, {even} of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, {audience: Heb. ears}</v>
      <v n="11">Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that {is} therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</v>
      <v n="12">And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</v>
      <v n="13">And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou {wilt give it}, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take {it} of me, and I will bury my dead there.</v>
      <v n="14">And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</v>
      <v n="15">My lord, hearken unto me: the land {is worth} four hundred shekels of silver; what {is} that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.</v>
      <v n="16">And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current {money} with the merchant.</v>
      <v n="17">And the field of Ephron, which {was} in Machpelah, which {was} before Mamre, the field, and the cave which {was} therein, and all the trees that {were} in the field, that {were} in all the borders round about, were made sure</v>
      <v n="18">Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</v>
      <v n="19">And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan.</v>
      <v n="20">And the field, and the cave that {is} therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</v>
