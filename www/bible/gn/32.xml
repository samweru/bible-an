      <v n="1">And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</v>
      <v n="2">And when Jacob saw them, he said, This {is} God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. {Mahanaim: that is, Two hosts, or, camps}</v>
      <v n="3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. {country: Heb. field}</v>
      <v n="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:</v>
      <v n="5">And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</v>
      <v n="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</v>
      <v n="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that {was} with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;</v>
      <v n="8">And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</v>
      <v n="9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</v>
      <v n="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. {I am not...: Heb. I am less than all}</v>
      <v n="11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, {and} the mother with the children. {with: Heb. upon}</v>
      <v n="12">And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</v>
      <v n="13">And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</v>
      <v n="14">Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,</v>
      <v n="15">Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</v>
      <v n="16">And he delivered {them} into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</v>
      <v n="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose {art} thou? and whither goest thou? and whose {are} these before thee?</v>
      <v n="18">Then thou shalt say, {They be} thy servant Jacob's; it {is} a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he {is} behind us.</v>
      <v n="19">And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.</v>
      <v n="20">And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob {is} behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. {of me: Heb. my face}</v>
      <v n="21">So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</v>
      <v n="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</v>
      <v n="23">And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. {sent them: Heb. caused to pass}</v>
      <v n="24">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. {breaking...: Heb. ascending of the morning}</v>
      <v n="25">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</v>
      <v n="26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</v>
      <v n="27">And he said unto him, What {is} thy name? And he said, Jacob.</v>
      <v n="28">And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. {Israel: that is, A prince of God}</v>
      <v n="29">And Jacob asked {him}, and said, Tell {me}, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore {is} it {that} thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</v>
      <v n="30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. {Peniel: that is, The face of God}</v>
      <v n="31">And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</v>
      <v n="32">Therefore the children of Israel eat not {of} the sinew which shrank, which {is} upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</v>
