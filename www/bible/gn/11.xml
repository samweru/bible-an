      <v n="1">And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. {language: Heb. lip.} {speech: Heb. words}</v>
      <v n="2">And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. {from...: or, eastward}</v>
      <v n="3">And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. {they said...: Heb. a man said to his neighbour} {burn...: Heb. burn them to a burning}</v>
      <v n="4">And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top {may reach} unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</v>
      <v n="5">And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD said, Behold, the people {is} one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</v>
      <v n="7">Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.</v>
      <v n="8">So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</v>
      <v n="9">Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. {Babel: that is, Confusion}</v>
      <v n="10">These {are} the generations of Shem: Shem {was} an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</v>
      <v n="11">And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="12">And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</v>
      <v n="13">And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="14">And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</v>
      <v n="15">And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="16">And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: {Peleg: Gr. Phalec}</v>
      <v n="17">And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="18">And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</v>
      <v n="19">And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="20">And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: {Serug: Gr. Saruch}</v>
      <v n="21">And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="22">And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</v>
      <v n="23">And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="24">And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: {Terah: Gr. Thara}</v>
      <v n="25">And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</v>
      <v n="26">And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</v>
      <v n="27">Now these {are} the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</v>
      <v n="28">And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</v>
      <v n="29">And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife {was} Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</v>
      <v n="30">But Sarai was barren; she {had} no child.</v>
      <v n="31">And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</v>
      <v n="32">And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</v>
