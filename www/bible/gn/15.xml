      <v n="1">After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I {am} thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward.</v>
      <v n="2">And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house {is} this Eliezer of Damascus?</v>
      <v n="3">And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</v>
      <v n="4">And, behold, the word of the LORD {came} unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</v>
      <v n="5">And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</v>
      <v n="6">And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</v>
      <v n="7">And he said unto him, I {am} the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</v>
      <v n="8">And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</v>
      <v n="9">And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</v>
      <v n="10">And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</v>
      <v n="11">And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</v>
      <v n="12">And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</v>
      <v n="13">And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land {that is} not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</v>
      <v n="14">And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</v>
      <v n="15">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</v>
      <v n="16">But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites {is} not yet full.</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. {a burning...: Heb. a lamp of fire}</v>
      <v n="18">In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</v>
      <v n="19">The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</v>
      <v n="20">And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</v>
      <v n="21">And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</v>
