      <v n="1">And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</v>
      <v n="2">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</v>
      <v n="3">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the {other} kine upon the brink of the river.</v>
      <v n="4">And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</v>
      <v n="5">And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. {rank: Heb. fat}</v>
      <v n="6">And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</v>
      <v n="7">And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, {it was} a dream.</v>
      <v n="8">And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but {there was} none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="9">Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</v>
      <v n="10">Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, {both} me and the chief baker:</v>
      <v n="11">And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</v>
      <v n="12">And {there was} there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</v>
      <v n="13">And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</v>
      <v n="14">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved {himself}, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. {brought...: Heb. made him run}</v>
      <v n="15">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and {there is} none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, {that} thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. {thou...: or, when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it}</v>
      <v n="16">And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, {It is} not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</v>
      <v n="17">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:</v>
      <v n="18">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</v>
      <v n="19">And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</v>
      <v n="20">And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:</v>
      <v n="21">And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they {were} still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. {eaten...: Heb. come to the inward parts of them}</v>
      <v n="22">And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</v>
      <v n="23">And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, {and} blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: {withered: or, small}</v>
      <v n="24">And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told {this} unto the magicians; but {there was} none that could declare {it} to me.</v>
      <v n="25">And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh {is} one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he {is} about to do.</v>
      <v n="26">The seven good kine {are} seven years; and the seven good ears {are} seven years: the dream {is} one.</v>
      <v n="27">And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them {are} seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</v>
      <v n="28">This {is} the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God {is} about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="29">Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</v>
      <v n="30">And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</v>
      <v n="31">And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it {shall be} very grievous. {grievous: Heb. heavy}</v>
      <v n="32">And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; {it is} because the thing {is} established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. {established...: or, prepared of God}</v>
      <v n="33">Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="34">Let Pharaoh do {this}, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. {officers: or, overseers}</v>
      <v n="35">And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</v>
      <v n="36">And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. {perish...: Heb. be not cut off}</v>
      <v n="37">And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</v>
      <v n="38">And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find {such a one} as this {is}, a man in whom the Spirit of God {is}?</v>
      <v n="39">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, {there is} none so discreet and wise as thou {art}:</v>
      <v n="40">Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. {be ruled: Heb. be armed, or, kiss}</v>
      <v n="41">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="42">And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; {fine...: or, silk}</v>
      <v n="43">And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him {ruler} over all the land of Egypt. {Bow...: or, Tender father: Heb. Abrech}</v>
      <v n="44">And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I {am} Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="45">And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over {all} the land of Egypt. {Zaphnathpaaneah: which in the Coptic signifies, A revealer of secrets, or, The man to whom secrets are revealed} {priest: or, prince}</v>
      <v n="46">And Joseph {was} thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="47">And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</v>
      <v n="48">And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which {was} round about every city, laid he up in the same.</v>
      <v n="49">And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for {it was} without number.</v>
      <v n="50">And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. {priest: or, prince}</v>
      <v n="51">And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, {said he}, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. {Manasseh: that is, Forgetting}</v>
      <v n="52">And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. {Ephraim: that is, Fruitful}</v>
      <v n="53">And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</v>
      <v n="54">And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</v>
      <v n="55">And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</v>
      <v n="56">And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. {all the storehouses: Heb. all wherein was}</v>
      <v n="57">And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy {corn}; because that the famine was {so} sore in all lands.</v>
