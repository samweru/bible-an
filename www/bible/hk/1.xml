      <v n="1">The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</v>
      <v n="2">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! {even} cry out unto thee {of} violence, and thou wilt not save!</v>
      <v n="3">Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause {me} to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence {are} before me: and there are {that} raise up strife and contention.</v>
      <v n="4">Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. {wrong: or, wrested}</v>
      <v n="5">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for {I} will work a work in your days, {which} ye will not believe, though it be told {you}.</v>
      <v n="6">For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, {that} bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces {that are} not theirs. {breadth: Heb. breadths}</v>
      <v n="7">They {are} terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. {their judgment...: or, from them shall proceed the judgment of these, and the captivity of these}</v>
      <v n="8">Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle {that} hasteth to eat. {fierce: Heb. sharp}</v>
      <v n="9">They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up {as} the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. {their...: or, the supping up of their faces, etc: or, their faces shall look (Heb. the opposition of their faces) toward the east}</v>
      <v n="10">And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</v>
      <v n="11">Then shall {his} mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, {imputing} this his power unto his god.</v>
      <v n="12">{Art} thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. {mighty...: Heb. rock} {established: Heb. founded}</v>
      <v n="13">{Thou art} of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, {and} holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth {the man that is} more righteous than he? {iniquity: or, grievance}</v>
      <v n="14">And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, {that have} no ruler over them? {creeping: or, moving}</v>
      <v n="15">They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. {drag: or, flue net}</v>
      <v n="16">Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion {is} fat, and their meat plenteous. {plenteous: or, dainty: Heb. fat}</v>
      <v n="17">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</v>
