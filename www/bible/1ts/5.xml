      <v n="1">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</v>
      <v n="2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</v>
      <v n="3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</v>
      <v n="4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</v>
      <v n="5">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</v>
      <v n="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as {do} others; but let us watch and be sober.</v>
      <v n="7">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</v>
      <v n="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</v>
      <v n="9">For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</v>
      <v n="10">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</v>
      <v n="11">Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. {comfort: or, exhort}</v>
      <v n="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</v>
      <v n="13">And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. {And} be at peace among yourselves.</v>
      <v n="14">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all {men}. {exhort: or, beseech} {unruly: or, disorderly}</v>
      <v n="15">See that none render evil for evil unto any {man}; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all {men}.</v>
      <v n="16">Rejoice evermore.</v>
      <v n="17">Pray without ceasing.</v>
      <v n="18">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</v>
      <v n="19">Quench not the Spirit.</v>
      <v n="20">Despise not prophesyings.</v>
      <v n="21">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</v>
      <v n="22">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</v>
      <v n="23">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and {I pray God} your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v n="24">Faithful {is} he that calleth you, who also will do {it}.</v>
      <v n="25">Brethren, pray for us.</v>
      <v n="26">Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</v>
      <v n="27">I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren. {charge: or, adjure}</v>
      <v n="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with you. Amen. «{The first epistle} to the Thessalonians was written from Athens.»</v>
