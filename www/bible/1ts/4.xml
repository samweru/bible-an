      <v n="1">Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort {you} by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, {so} ye would abound more and more. {beseech: or, request} {exhort: or, beseech}</v>
      <v n="2">For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</v>
      <v n="3">For this is the will of God, {even} your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</v>
      <v n="4">That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</v>
      <v n="5">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</v>
      <v n="6">That no {man} go beyond and defraud his brother in {any} matter: because that the Lord {is} the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. {defraud: or, oppress, or, overreach} {in...: or, in the matter}</v>
      <v n="7">For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</v>
      <v n="8">He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. {despiseth: or, rejecteth}</v>
      <v n="9">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</v>
      <v n="10">And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</v>
      <v n="11">And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</v>
      <v n="12">That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and {that} ye may have lack of nothing. {of...: or, of no man}</v>
      <v n="13">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</v>
      <v n="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</v>
      <v n="15">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive {and} remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. {prevent: or, come before, or, anticipate, or, precede}</v>
      <v n="16">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</v>
      <v n="17">Then we which are alive {and} remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</v>
      <v n="18">Wherefore comfort one another with these words. {comfort: or, exhort}</v>
