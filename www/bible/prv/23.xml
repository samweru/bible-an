      <v n="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what {is} before thee:</v>
      <v n="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou {be} a man given to appetite.</v>
      <v n="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they {are} deceitful meat.</v>
      <v n="4">Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</v>
      <v n="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for {riches} certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. {set...: Heb. cause thine eyes to fly upon}</v>
      <v n="6">Eat thou not the bread of {him that hath} an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</v>
      <v n="7">For as he thinketh in his heart, so {is} he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart {is} not with thee.</v>
      <v n="8">The morsel {which} thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</v>
      <v n="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</v>
      <v n="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless: {landmark: or, bound}</v>
      <v n="11">For their redeemer {is} mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</v>
      <v n="12">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</v>
      <v n="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for {if} thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</v>
      <v n="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</v>
      <v n="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. {even...: or, even I will rejoice}</v>
      <v n="16">Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</v>
      <v n="17">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but {be thou} in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</v>
      <v n="18">For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off. {end: or, reward}</v>
      <v n="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</v>
      <v n="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: {of flesh: Heb. of their flesh}</v>
      <v n="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe {a man} with rags.</v>
      <v n="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</v>
      <v n="23">Buy the truth, and sell {it} not; {also} wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</v>
      <v n="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise {child} shall have joy of him.</v>
      <v n="25">Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</v>
      <v n="26">My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</v>
      <v n="27">For a whore {is} a deep ditch; and a strange woman {is} a narrow pit.</v>
      <v n="28">She also lieth in wait as {for} a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men. {as for...: or, as a robber}</v>
      <v n="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</v>
      <v n="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</v>
      <v n="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, {when} it moveth itself aright.</v>
      <v n="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. {an...: or, a cockatrice}</v>
      <v n="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</v>
      <v n="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. {the midst...: Heb. the heart of the sea}</v>
      <v n="35">They have stricken me, {shalt thou say, and} I was not sick; they have beaten me, {and} I felt {it} not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again. {I felt...: Heb. I knew it not}</v>
