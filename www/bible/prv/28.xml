      <v n="1">The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</v>
      <v n="2">For the transgression of a land many {are} the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding {and} knowledge the state {thereof} shall be prolonged. {by...: or, by men of understanding and wisdom shall they likewise be prolonged}</v>
      <v n="3">A poor man that oppresseth the poor {is like} a sweeping rain which leaveth no food. {which...: Heb. without food}</v>
      <v n="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</v>
      <v n="5">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all {things}.</v>
      <v n="6">Better {is} the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than {he that is} perverse {in his} ways, though he {be} rich.</v>
      <v n="7">Whoso keepeth the law {is} a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous {men} shameth his father. {is a companion...: or, feedeth gluttons}</v>
      <v n="8">He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor. {unjust...: Heb. by increase}</v>
      <v n="9">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer {shall be} abomination.</v>
      <v n="10">Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good {things} in possession.</v>
      <v n="11">The rich man {is} wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out. {own...: Heb. eyes}</v>
      <v n="12">When righteous {men} do rejoice, {there is} great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. {hidden: or, sought for}</v>
      <v n="13">He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh {them} shall have mercy.</v>
      <v n="14">Happy {is} the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</v>
      <v n="15">{As} a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; {so is} a wicked ruler over the poor people.</v>
      <v n="16">The prince that wanteth understanding {is} also a great oppressor: {but} he that hateth covetousness shall prolong {his} days.</v>
      <v n="17">A man that doeth violence to the blood of {any} person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</v>
      <v n="18">Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but {he that is} perverse {in his} ways shall fall at once.</v>
      <v n="19">He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain {persons} shall have poverty enough.</v>
      <v n="20">A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent. {innocent: or, unpunished}</v>
      <v n="21">To have respect of persons {is} not good: for for a piece of bread {that} man will transgress.</v>
      <v n="22">He that hasteth to be rich {hath} an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him. {hasteth...: or, hath an evil eye hasteth to be rich}</v>
      <v n="23">He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</v>
      <v n="24">Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, {It is} no transgression; the same {is} the companion of a destroyer. {a destroyer: Heb. a man destroying}</v>
      <v n="25">He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</v>
      <v n="26">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</v>
      <v n="27">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</v>
      <v n="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</v>
