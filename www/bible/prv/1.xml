      <v n="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</v>
      <v n="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</v>
      <v n="3">To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; {equity: Heb. equities}</v>
      <v n="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. {discretion: or, advisement}</v>
      <v n="5">A wise {man} will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</v>
      <v n="6">To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. {the interpretation: or, an eloquent speech}</v>
      <v n="7">The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of knowledge: {but} fools despise wisdom and instruction. {the beginning: or, the principal part}</v>
      <v n="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</v>
      <v n="9">For they {shall be} an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. {an...: Heb. an adding}</v>
      <v n="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</v>
      <v n="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</v>
      <v n="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</v>
      <v n="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</v>
      <v n="14">Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</v>
      <v n="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</v>
      <v n="16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</v>
      <v n="17">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. {in the...: Heb. in the eyes of every thing that hath a wing}</v>
      <v n="18">And they lay wait for their {own} blood; they lurk privily for their {own} lives.</v>
      <v n="19">So {are} the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; {which} taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</v>
      <v n="20">Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: {Wisdom: Heb. Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom}</v>
      <v n="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, {saying},</v>
      <v n="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</v>
      <v n="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</v>
      <v n="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</v>
      <v n="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</v>
      <v n="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</v>
      <v n="27">When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</v>
      <v n="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</v>
      <v n="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</v>
      <v n="30">They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</v>
      <v n="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</v>
      <v n="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. {turning...: or, ease of the simple}</v>
      <v n="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</v>
