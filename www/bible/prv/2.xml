      <v n="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</v>
      <v n="2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, {and} apply thine heart to understanding;</v>
      <v n="3">Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, {and} liftest up thy voice for understanding; {liftest...: Heb. givest thy voice}</v>
      <v n="4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as {for} hid treasures;</v>
      <v n="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</v>
      <v n="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth {cometh} knowledge and understanding.</v>
      <v n="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: {he is} a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</v>
      <v n="8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</v>
      <v n="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; {yea}, every good path.</v>
      <v n="10">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</v>
      <v n="11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</v>
      <v n="12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil {man}, from the man that speaketh froward things;</v>
      <v n="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</v>
      <v n="14">Who rejoice to do evil, {and} delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</v>
      <v n="15">Whose ways {are} crooked, and {they} froward in their paths:</v>
      <v n="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, {even} from the stranger {which} flattereth with her words;</v>
      <v n="17">Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</v>
      <v n="18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</v>
      <v n="19">None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</v>
      <v n="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good {men}, and keep the paths of the righteous.</v>
      <v n="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</v>
      <v n="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it. {rooted: or, plucked up}</v>
