      <v n="1">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</v>
      <v n="2">What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</v>
      <v n="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</v>
      <v n="4">{It is} not for kings, O Lemuel, {it is} not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</v>
      <v n="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. {prevert: Heb. alter} {of any...: Heb. of all the sons of affliction}</v>
      <v n="6">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. {of...: Heb. bitter of soul}</v>
      <v n="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</v>
      <v n="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction. {such...: Heb. the sons of destruction}</v>
      <v n="9">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</v>
      <v n="10">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price {is} far above rubies.</v>
      <v n="11">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</v>
      <v n="12">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</v>
      <v n="13">She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</v>
      <v n="14">She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</v>
      <v n="15">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</v>
      <v n="16">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. {buyeth: Heb. taketh}</v>
      <v n="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</v>
      <v n="18">She perceiveth that her merchandise {is} good: her candle goeth not out by night. {She...: Heb. She tasteth}</v>
      <v n="19">She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</v>
      <v n="20">She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy. {She...: Heb. She spreadeth}</v>
      <v n="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household {are} clothed with scarlet. {scarlet: or, double garments}</v>
      <v n="22">She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing {is} silk and purple.</v>
      <v n="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</v>
      <v n="24">She maketh fine linen, and selleth {it}; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</v>
      <v n="25">Strength and honour {are} her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</v>
      <v n="26">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue {is} the law of kindness.</v>
      <v n="27">She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</v>
      <v n="28">Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband {also}, and he praiseth her.</v>
      <v n="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. {have...: or, have gotten riches}</v>
      <v n="30">Favour {is} deceitful, and beauty {is} vain: {but} a woman {that} feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</v>
      <v n="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</v>
