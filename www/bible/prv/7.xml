      <v n="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</v>
      <v n="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</v>
      <v n="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</v>
      <v n="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou {art} my sister; and call understanding {thy} kinswoman:</v>
      <v n="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger {which} flattereth with her words.</v>
      <v n="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</v>
      <v n="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, {the youths: Heb. the sons}</v>
      <v n="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</v>
      <v n="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: {in the evening: Heb. in the evening of days}</v>
      <v n="10">And, behold, there met him a woman {with} the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</v>
      <v n="11">(She {is} loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</v>
      <v n="12">Now {is she} without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</v>
      <v n="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, {and} with an impudent face said unto him, {with...: Heb. she strengthened her face and said}</v>
      <v n="14">{I have} peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows. {I have...: Heb. Peace offerings are upon me}</v>
      <v n="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</v>
      <v n="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved {works}, with fine linen of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</v>
      <v n="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</v>
      <v n="19">For the goodman {is} not at home, he is gone a long journey:</v>
      <v n="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, {and} will come home at the day appointed. {with...: Heb. in his hand} {the day...: or, the new moon}</v>
      <v n="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</v>
      <v n="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; {straightway: Heb. suddenly}</v>
      <v n="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it {is} for his life.</v>
      <v n="24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</v>
      <v n="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</v>
      <v n="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong {men} have been slain by her.</v>
      <v n="27">Her house {is} the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</v>
