      <v n="1">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</v>
      <v n="2">She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</v>
      <v n="3">She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</v>
      <v n="4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice {is} to the sons of man.</v>
      <v n="5">O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</v>
      <v n="6">Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips {shall be} right things.</v>
      <v n="7">For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness {is} an abomination to my lips. {an...: Heb. the abomination of my lips}</v>
      <v n="8">All the words of my mouth {are} in righteousness; {there is} nothing froward or perverse in them. {froward: Heb. wreathed}</v>
      <v n="9">They {are} all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</v>
      <v n="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</v>
      <v n="11">For wisdom {is} better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</v>
      <v n="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. {prudence: or, subtilty}</v>
      <v n="13">The fear of the LORD {is} to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</v>
      <v n="14">Counsel {is} mine, and sound wisdom: I {am} understanding; I have strength.</v>
      <v n="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</v>
      <v n="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, {even} all the judges of the earth.</v>
      <v n="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</v>
      <v n="18">Riches and honour {are} with me; {yea}, durable riches and righteousness.</v>
      <v n="19">My fruit {is} better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</v>
      <v n="20">I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: {lead: or, walk}</v>
      <v n="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</v>
      <v n="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</v>
      <v n="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</v>
      <v n="24">When {there were} no depths, I was brought forth; when {there were} no fountains abounding with water.</v>
      <v n="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</v>
      <v n="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. {fields: or, open places} {the highest...: or, the chief part}</v>
      <v n="27">When he prepared the heavens, I {was} there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth: {a compass: or, a circle}</v>
      <v n="28">When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</v>
      <v n="29">When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</v>
      <v n="30">Then I was by him, {as} one brought up {with him}: and I was daily {his} delight, rejoicing always before him;</v>
      <v n="31">Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights {were} with the sons of men.</v>
      <v n="32">Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed {are they that} keep my ways.</v>
      <v n="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</v>
      <v n="34">Blessed {is} the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</v>
      <v n="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. {obtain: Heb. bring forth}</v>
      <v n="36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</v>
