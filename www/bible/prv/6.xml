      <v n="1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, {if} thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</v>
      <v n="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</v>
      <v n="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. {and make...: or, so shalt thou prevail with thy friend}</v>
      <v n="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</v>
      <v n="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand {of the hunter}, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</v>
      <v n="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</v>
      <v n="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</v>
      <v n="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, {and} gathereth her food in the harvest.</v>
      <v n="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</v>
      <v n="10">{Yet} a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</v>
      <v n="11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</v>
      <v n="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</v>
      <v n="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</v>
      <v n="14">Frowardness {is} in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord. {soweth: Heb. casteth forth}</v>
      <v n="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</v>
      <v n="16">These six {things} doth the LORD hate: yea, seven {are} an abomination unto him: {unto...: Heb. of his soul}</v>
      <v n="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, {A proud...: Heb. Haughty eyes}</v>
      <v n="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</v>
      <v n="19">A false witness {that} speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</v>
      <v n="20">My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</v>
      <v n="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, {and} tie them about thy neck.</v>
      <v n="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and {when} thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</v>
      <v n="23">For the commandment {is} a lamp; and the law {is} light; and reproofs of instruction {are} the way of life: {lamp: or, candle}</v>
      <v n="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. {of the...: or, of the strange tongue}</v>
      <v n="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</v>
      <v n="26">For by means of a whorish woman {a man is brought} to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. {the adulteress: Heb. the woman of a man, or, a man's wife}</v>
      <v n="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</v>
      <v n="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</v>
      <v n="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</v>
      <v n="30">{Men} do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</v>
      <v n="31">But {if} he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</v>
      <v n="32">{But} whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he {that} doeth it destroyeth his own soul. {understanding: Heb. heart}</v>
      <v n="33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</v>
      <v n="34">For jealousy {is} the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</v>
      <v n="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. {He will...: Heb. He will not accept the face of any ransom}</v>
