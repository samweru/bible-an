      <v n="1">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, {even} the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</v>
      <v n="2">Surely I {am} more brutish than {any} man, and have not the understanding of a man.</v>
      <v n="3">I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. {have: Heb. know}</v>
      <v n="4">Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what {is} his name, and what {is} his son's name, if thou canst tell?</v>
      <v n="5">Every word of God {is} pure: he {is} a shield unto them that put their trust in him. {pure: Heb. purified}</v>
      <v n="6">Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</v>
      <v n="7">Two {things} have I required of thee; deny me {them} not before I die: {deny...: Heb. withhold not from me}</v>
      <v n="8">Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: {convenient...: Heb. of my allowance}</v>
      <v n="9">Lest I be full, and deny {thee}, and say, Who {is} the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God {in vain}. {deny...: Heb. belie thee}</v>
      <v n="10">Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty. {Accuse...: Heb. Hurt not with thy tongue}</v>
      <v n="11">{There is} a generation {that} curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</v>
      <v n="12">{There is} a generation {that are} pure in their own eyes, and {yet} is not washed from their filthiness.</v>
      <v n="13">{There is} a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</v>
      <v n="14">{There is} a generation, whose teeth {are as} swords, and their jaw teeth {as} knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from {among} men.</v>
      <v n="15">The horseleach hath two daughters, {crying}, Give, give. There are three {things that} are never satisfied, {yea}, four {things} say not, {It is} enough: {It is...: Heb. Wealth}</v>
      <v n="16">The grave; and the barren womb; the earth {that} is not filled with water; and the fire {that} saith not, {It is} enough.</v>
      <v n="17">The eye {that} mocketh at {his} father, and despiseth to obey {his} mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. {the valley: or, the brook}</v>
      <v n="18">There be three {things which} are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</v>
      <v n="19">The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. {midst: Heb. heart}</v>
      <v n="20">Such {is} the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</v>
      <v n="21">For three {things} the earth is disquieted, and for four {which} it cannot bear:</v>
      <v n="22">For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</v>
      <v n="23">For an odious {woman} when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</v>
      <v n="24">There be four {things which are} little upon the earth, but they {are} exceeding wise: {exceeding...: Heb. wise, made wise}</v>
      <v n="25">The ants {are} a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</v>
      <v n="26">The conies {are but} a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</v>
      <v n="27">The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; {by...: Heb. gathered together}</v>
      <v n="28">The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</v>
      <v n="29">There be three {things} which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</v>
      <v n="30">A lion {which is} strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</v>
      <v n="31">A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom {there is} no rising up. {greyhound: or, horse: Heb. girt in the loins}</v>
      <v n="32">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, {lay} thine hand upon thy mouth.</v>
      <v n="33">Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</v>
