      <v n="1">My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</v>
      <v n="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. {long...: Heb. years of life}</v>
      <v n="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</v>
      <v n="4">So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man. {good...: or, good success}</v>
      <v n="5">Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</v>
      <v n="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</v>
      <v n="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</v>
      <v n="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. {health: Heb. medicine} {marrow: Heb. watering, or, moistening}</v>
      <v n="9">Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</v>
      <v n="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</v>
      <v n="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</v>
      <v n="12">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son {in whom} he delighteth.</v>
      <v n="13">Happy {is} the man {that} findeth wisdom, and the man {that} getteth understanding. {that getteth...: Heb. that draweth out understanding}</v>
      <v n="14">For the merchandise of it {is} better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</v>
      <v n="15">She {is} more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</v>
      <v n="16">Length of days {is} in her right hand; {and} in her left hand riches and honour.</v>
      <v n="17">Her ways {are} ways of pleasantness, and all her paths {are} peace.</v>
      <v n="18">She {is} a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy {is every one} that retaineth her.</v>
      <v n="19">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. {established: or, prepared}</v>
      <v n="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</v>
      <v n="21">My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</v>
      <v n="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</v>
      <v n="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</v>
      <v n="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</v>
      <v n="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</v>
      <v n="26">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</v>
      <v n="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do {it}. {them...: Heb. the owners thereof}</v>
      <v n="28">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</v>
      <v n="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee. {Devise...: or, Practise no evil}</v>
      <v n="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</v>
      <v n="31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. {the oppressor: Heb. a man of violence}</v>
      <v n="32">For the froward {is} abomination to the LORD: but his secret {is} with the righteous.</v>
      <v n="33">The curse of the LORD {is} in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</v>
      <v n="34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</v>
      <v n="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools. {shall be...: Heb. exalteth the fools}</v>
