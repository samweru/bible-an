      <v n="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</v>
      <v n="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. {her beasts: Heb. her killing}</v>
      <v n="3">She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</v>
      <v n="4">Whoso {is} simple, let him turn in hither: {as for} him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</v>
      <v n="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine {which} I have mingled.</v>
      <v n="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</v>
      <v n="7">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked {man getteth} himself a blot.</v>
      <v n="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</v>
      <v n="9">Give {instruction} to a wise {man}, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just {man}, and he will increase in learning.</v>
      <v n="10">The fear of the LORD {is} the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy {is} understanding.</v>
      <v n="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</v>
      <v n="12">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but {if} thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear {it}.</v>
      <v n="13">A foolish woman {is} clamorous: {she is} simple, and knoweth nothing.</v>
      <v n="14">For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</v>
      <v n="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</v>
      <v n="16">Whoso {is} simple, let him turn in hither: and {as for} him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</v>
      <v n="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread {eaten} in secret is pleasant. {eaten...: Heb. of secrecies}</v>
      <v n="18">But he knoweth not that the dead {are} there; {and that} her guests {are} in the depths of hell.</v>
