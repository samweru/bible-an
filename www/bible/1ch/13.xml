      <v n="1">And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, {and} with every leader.</v>
      <v n="2">And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If {it seem} good unto you, and {that it be} of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, {that are} left in all the land of Israel, and with them {also} to the priests and Levites {which are} in their cities {and} suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: {send...: Heb. break forth and send} {in their...: Heb. in the cities of their suburbs}</v>
      <v n="3">And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. {bring...: Heb. bring about}</v>
      <v n="4">And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</v>
      <v n="5">So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</v>
      <v n="6">And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, {that is}, to Kirjathjearim, which {belonged} to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth {between} the cherubims, whose name is called {on it}.</v>
      <v n="7">And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. {carried...: Heb. made the ark to ride}</v>
      <v n="8">And David and all Israel played before God with all {their} might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. {singing: Heb. songs}</v>
      <v n="9">And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. {Chidon: also called Nachon} {stumbled: or, shook it}</v>
      <v n="10">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</v>
      <v n="11">And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. {Perezuzza: that is, The breach of Uzza}</v>
      <v n="12">And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God {home} to me?</v>
      <v n="13">So David brought not the ark {home} to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. {brought: Heb. removed}</v>
      <v n="14">And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</v>
