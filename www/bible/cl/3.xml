      <v n="1">If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</v>
      <v n="2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. {affection: or, mind}</v>
      <v n="3">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</v>
      <v n="4">When Christ, {who is} our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</v>
      <v n="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</v>
      <v n="6">For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</v>
      <v n="7">In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</v>
      <v n="8">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</v>
      <v n="9">Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</v>
      <v n="10">And have put on the new {man}, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</v>
      <v n="11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond {nor} free: but Christ {is} all, and in all.</v>
      <v n="12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</v>
      <v n="13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also {do} ye. {quarrel: or, complaint}</v>
      <v n="14">And above all these things {put on} charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</v>
      <v n="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</v>
      <v n="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</v>
      <v n="17">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, {do} all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</v>
      <v n="18">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</v>
      <v n="19">Husbands, love {your} wives, and be not bitter against them.</v>
      <v n="20">Children, obey {your} parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</v>
      <v n="21">Fathers, provoke not your children {to anger}, lest they be discouraged.</v>
      <v n="22">Servants, obey in all things {your} masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</v>
      <v n="23">And whatsoever ye do, do {it} heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</v>
      <v n="24">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</v>
      <v n="25">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</v>
