      <v n="1">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, {which is} your reasonable service.</v>
      <v n="2">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what {is} that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</v>
      <v n="3">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think {of himself} more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. {soberly: Gr. to sobriety}</v>
      <v n="4">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</v>
      <v n="5">So we, {being} many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</v>
      <v n="6">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, {let us prophesy} according to the proportion of faith;</v>
      <v n="7">Or ministry, {let us wait} on {our} ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</v>
      <v n="8">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, {let him do it} with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness. {giveth: or, imparteth} {with simplicity: or, liberally}</v>
      <v n="9">{Let} love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</v>
      <v n="10">{Be} kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; {with...: or, in the love of the brethren}</v>
      <v n="11">Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</v>
      <v n="12">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</v>
      <v n="13">Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</v>
      <v n="14">Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</v>
      <v n="15">Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</v>
      <v n="16">{Be} of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. {condescend...: or, be contented with mean things}</v>
      <v n="17">Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</v>
      <v n="18">If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</v>
      <v n="19">Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but {rather} give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance {is} mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</v>
      <v n="20">Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</v>
      <v n="21">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</v>
