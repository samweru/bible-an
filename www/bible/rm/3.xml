      <v n="1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit {is there} of circumcision?</v>
      <v n="2">Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</v>
      <v n="3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</v>
      <v n="4">God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</v>
      <v n="5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? {Is} God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</v>
      <v n="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</v>
      <v n="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</v>
      <v n="8">And not {rather}, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</v>
      <v n="9">What then? are we better {than they}? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; {proved: Gr. charged}</v>
      <v n="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</v>
      <v n="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</v>
      <v n="12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</v>
      <v n="13">Their throat {is} an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps {is} under their lips:</v>
      <v n="14">Whose mouth {is} full of cursing and bitterness:</v>
      <v n="15">Their feet {are} swift to shed blood:</v>
      <v n="16">Destruction and misery {are} in their ways:</v>
      <v n="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</v>
      <v n="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</v>
      <v n="19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. {guilty...: or, subject to the judgment of God}</v>
      <v n="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law {is} the knowledge of sin.</v>
      <v n="21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</v>
      <v n="22">Even the righteousness of God {which is} by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</v>
      <v n="23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</v>
      <v n="24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</v>
      <v n="25">Whom God hath set forth {to be} a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; {set forth: or, foreordained} {remission: or, passing over}</v>
      <v n="26">To declare, {I say}, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</v>
      <v n="27">Where {is} boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</v>
      <v n="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</v>
      <v n="29">{Is he} the God of the Jews only? {is he} not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</v>
      <v n="30">Seeing {it is} one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</v>
      <v n="31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</v>
