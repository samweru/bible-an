      <v n="1">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called {to be} an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</v>
      <v n="2">(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</v>
      <v n="3">Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</v>
      <v n="4">And declared {to be} the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: {declared: Gr. determined}</v>
      <v n="5">By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: {for obedience...: or, to the obedience of faith}</v>
      <v n="6">Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</v>
      <v n="7">To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called {to be} saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</v>
      <v n="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</v>
      <v n="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; {with: or, in}</v>
      <v n="10">Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</v>
      <v n="11">For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</v>
      <v n="12">That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. {with: or, in}</v>
      <v n="13">Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. {among: or, in}</v>
      <v n="14">I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</v>
      <v n="15">So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</v>
      <v n="16">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</v>
      <v n="17">For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</v>
      <v n="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</v>
      <v n="19">Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed {it} unto them. {in them: or, to them}</v>
      <v n="20">For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, {even} his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: {so...: or, that they may be}</v>
      <v n="21">Because that, when they knew God, they glorified {him} not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</v>
      <v n="22">Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</v>
      <v n="23">And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</v>
      <v n="24">Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</v>
      <v n="25">Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. {more: or, rather}</v>
      <v n="26">For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</v>
      <v n="27">And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</v>
      <v n="28">And even as they did not like to retain God in {their} knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; {to retain: or, to acknowledge} {a reprobate...: or, a mind void of judgment or, an unapproving mind}</v>
      <v n="29">Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</v>
      <v n="30">Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</v>
      <v n="31">Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: {without natural...: or unsociable}</v>
      <v n="32">Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. {have...: or, consent with}</v>
