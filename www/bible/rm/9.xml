      <v n="1">I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</v>
      <v n="2">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</v>
      <v n="3">For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: {accursed: or, separated}</v>
      <v n="4">Who are Israelites; to whom {pertaineth} the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service {of God}, and the promises; {covenants: or, testaments}</v>
      <v n="5">Whose {are} the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ {came}, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</v>
      <v n="6">Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they {are} not all Israel, which are of Israel:</v>
      <v n="7">Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, {are they} all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</v>
      <v n="8">That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these {are} not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</v>
      <v n="9">For this {is} the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</v>
      <v n="10">And not only {this}; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, {even} by our father Isaac;</v>
      <v n="11">(For {the children} being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</v>
      <v n="12">It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. {elder: or, greater} {younger: or, lesser}</v>
      <v n="13">As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</v>
      <v n="14">What shall we say then? {Is there} unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</v>
      <v n="15">For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</v>
      <v n="16">So then {it is} not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</v>
      <v n="17">For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</v>
      <v n="18">Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will {have mercy}, and whom he will he hardeneth.</v>
      <v n="19">Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?</v>
      <v n="20">Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed {it}, Why hast thou made me thus? {repliest...: or, answerest again, or, disputest with God?}</v>
      <v n="21">Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</v>
      <v n="22">{What} if God, willing to shew {his} wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: {fitted: or, made up}</v>
      <v n="23">And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</v>
      <v n="24">Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</v>
      <v n="25">As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</v>
      <v n="26">And it shall come to pass, {that} in the place where it was said unto them, Ye {are} not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</v>
      <v n="27">Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</v>
      <v n="28">For he will finish the work, and cut {it} short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth. {the work: or, the account}</v>
      <v n="29">And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha. {Sabaoth: Heb. hosts}</v>
      <v n="30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</v>
      <v n="31">But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</v>
      <v n="32">Wherefore? Because {they sought it} not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</v>
      <v n="33">As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. {ashamed: or confounded}</v>
