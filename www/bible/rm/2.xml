      <v n="1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</v>
      <v n="2">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</v>
      <v n="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</v>
      <v n="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</v>
      <v n="5">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</v>
      <v n="6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</v>
      <v n="7">To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</v>
      <v n="8">But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</v>
      <v n="9">Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; {Gentile: Gr. Greek}</v>
      <v n="10">But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: {Gentile: Gr. Greek}</v>
      <v n="11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</v>
      <v n="12">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</v>
      <v n="13">(For not the hearers of the law {are} just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</v>
      <v n="14">For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</v>
      <v n="15">Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and {their} thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) {their conscience...: or, the conscience witnessing with them} {the mean...: or, between themselves}</v>
      <v n="16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</v>
      <v n="17">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</v>
      <v n="18">And knowest {his} will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; {approvest...: or, triest the things that differ}</v>
      <v n="19">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</v>
      <v n="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</v>
      <v n="21">Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</v>
      <v n="22">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</v>
      <v n="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</v>
      <v n="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</v>
      <v n="25">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</v>
      <v n="26">Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</v>
      <v n="27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</v>
      <v n="28">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither {is that} circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</v>
      <v n="29">But he {is} a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision {is that} of the heart, in the spirit, {and} not in the letter; whose praise {is} not of men, but of God.</v>
