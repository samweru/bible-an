      <v n="1">What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</v>
      <v n="2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath {whereof} to glory; but not before God.</v>
      <v n="3">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</v>
      <v n="4">Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</v>
      <v n="5">But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</v>
      <v n="6">Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</v>
      <v n="7">{Saying}, Blessed {are} they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</v>
      <v n="8">Blessed {is} the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</v>
      <v n="9">{Cometh} this blessedness then upon the circumcision {only}, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</v>
      <v n="10">How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</v>
      <v n="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which {he had yet} being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</v>
      <v n="12">And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which {he had} being {yet} uncircumcised.</v>
      <v n="13">For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, {was} not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</v>
      <v n="14">For if they which are of the law {be} heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</v>
      <v n="15">Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, {there is} no transgression.</v>
      <v n="16">Therefore {it is} of faith, that {it might be} by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</v>
      <v n="17">(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, {even} God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. {before him: or, like unto him}</v>
      <v n="18">Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</v>
      <v n="19">And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb:</v>
      <v n="20">He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</v>
      <v n="21">And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</v>
      <v n="22">And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</v>
      <v n="23">Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</v>
      <v n="24">But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</v>
      <v n="25">Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</v>
