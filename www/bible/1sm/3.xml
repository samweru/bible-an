      <v n="1">And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; {there was} no open vision.</v>
      <v n="2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli {was} laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, {that} he could not see;</v>
      <v n="3">And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God {was}, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep};</v>
      <v n="4">That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here {am} I.</v>
      <v n="5">And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</v>
      <v n="7">Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. {Now...: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the LORD, and before the word of the LORD was revealed unto him}</v>
      <v n="8">And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</v>
      <v n="9">Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</v>
      <v n="10">And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</v>
      <v n="11">And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</v>
      <v n="12">In that day I will perform against Eli all {things} which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. {when...: Heb. beginning and ending}</v>
      <v n="13">For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. {For I...: or, And I will tell him} {vile: or, accursed} {restrained...: Heb. frowned not upon them}</v>
      <v n="14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</v>
      <v n="15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</v>
      <v n="16">Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here {am} I.</v>
      <v n="17">And he said, What {is} the thing that {the LORD} hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide {it} not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide {any} thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. {more also: Heb. so add} {thing: or, word}</v>
      <v n="18">And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It {is} the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. {every...: Heb. all the things, or, words}</v>
      <v n="19">And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</v>
      <v n="20">And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel {was} established {to be} a prophet of the LORD. {established: or, faithful}</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</v>
