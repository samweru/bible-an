      <v n="1">Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, {reigned one...: Heb. the son of one year in his reigning}</v>
      <v n="2">Saul chose him three thousand {men} of Israel; {whereof} two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.</v>
      <v n="3">And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that {was} in Geba, and the Philistines heard {of it}. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. {Geba: or, the hill}</v>
      <v n="4">And all Israel heard say {that} Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and {that} Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. {was...: Heb. did stink}</v>
      <v n="5">And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which {is} on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</v>
      <v n="6">When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</v>
      <v n="7">And {some of} the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he {was} yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. {followed...: Heb. trembled after him}</v>
      <v n="8">And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel {had appointed}: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.</v>
      <v n="9">And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</v>
      <v n="10">And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. {salute: Heb. bless}</v>
      <v n="11">And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and {that} thou camest not within the days appointed, and {that} the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;</v>
      <v n="12">Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. {made...: Heb. intreated the face}</v>
      <v n="13">And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</v>
      <v n="14">But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him {to be} captain over his people, because thou hast not kept {that} which the LORD commanded thee.</v>
      <v n="15">And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people {that were} present with him, about six hundred men. {present: Heb. found}</v>
      <v n="16">And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people {that were} present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. {present: Heb. found} {Gibeah: Heb. Geba}</v>
      <v n="17">And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way {that leadeth to} Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:</v>
      <v n="18">And another company turned the way {to} Bethhoron: and another company turned {to} the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</v>
      <v n="19">Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make {them} swords or spears:</v>
      <v n="20">But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</v>
      <v n="21">Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. {a file: Heb. a file with mouths, or Heb. a pim, a third of a shekel} {sharpen: Heb. set}</v>
      <v n="22">So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that {were} with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</v>
      <v n="23">And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. {garrison: or, standing camp}</v>
