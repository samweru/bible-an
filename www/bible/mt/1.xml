      <v n="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</v>
      <v n="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</v>
      <v n="3">And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</v>
      <v n="4">And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</v>
      <v n="5">And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</v>
      <v n="6">And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her {that had been the wife} of Urias;</v>
      <v n="7">And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</v>
      <v n="8">And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</v>
      <v n="9">And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</v>
      <v n="10">And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</v>
      <v n="11">And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon: {Josias...: some read, Josias begat Jakim, and Jakim begat Jechonias}</v>
      <v n="12">And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</v>
      <v n="13">And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</v>
      <v n="14">And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</v>
      <v n="15">And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</v>
      <v n="16">And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</v>
      <v n="17">So all the generations from Abraham to David {are} fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon {are} fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ {are} fourteen generations.</v>
      <v n="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</v>
      <v n="19">Then Joseph her husband, being a just {man}, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</v>
      <v n="20">But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. {conceived: Gr. begotten}</v>
      <v n="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. {JESUS: that is, Saviour, Heb}</v>
      <v n="22">Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</v>
      <v n="23">Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. {they...: or, his name shall be called}</v>
      <v n="24">Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</v>
      <v n="25">And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</v>
