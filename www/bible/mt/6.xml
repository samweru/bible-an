      <v n="1">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. {alms: or, righteousness} {of your: or, with your}</v>
      <v n="2">Therefore when thou doest {thine} alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. {do not...: or, cause not a trumpet to be sounded}</v>
      <v n="3">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</v>
      <v n="4">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</v>
      <v n="5">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites {are}: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</v>
      <v n="6">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</v>
      <v n="7">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen {do}: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</v>
      <v n="8">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</v>
      <v n="9">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</v>
      <v n="10">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as {it is} in heaven.</v>
      <v n="11">Give us this day our daily bread.</v>
      <v n="12">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</v>
      <v n="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</v>
      <v n="14">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</v>
      <v n="15">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</v>
      <v n="16">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</v>
      <v n="17">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</v>
      <v n="18">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</v>
      <v n="19">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</v>
      <v n="20">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</v>
      <v n="21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</v>
      <v n="22">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</v>
      <v n="23">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great {is} that darkness!</v>
      <v n="24">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</v>
      <v n="25">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</v>
      <v n="26">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</v>
      <v n="27">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</v>
      <v n="28">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</v>
      <v n="29">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</v>
      <v n="30">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, {shall he} not much more {clothe} you, O ye of little faith?</v>
      <v n="31">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</v>
      <v n="32">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</v>
      <v n="33">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</v>
      <v n="34">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day {is} the evil thereof.</v>
