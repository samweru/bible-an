      <v n="1">A good name {is} better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</v>
      <v n="2">{It is} better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that {is} the end of all men; and the living will lay {it} to his heart.</v>
      <v n="3">Sorrow {is} better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. {Sorrow: or, Anger}</v>
      <v n="4">The heart of the wise {is} in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools {is} in the house of mirth.</v>
      <v n="5">{It is} better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</v>
      <v n="6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so {is} the laughter of the fool: this also {is} vanity. {crackling: Heb. sound}</v>
      <v n="7">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</v>
      <v n="8">Better {is} the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: {and} the patient in spirit {is} better than the proud in spirit.</v>
      <v n="9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</v>
      <v n="10">Say not thou, What is {the cause} that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. {wisely: Heb. out of wisdom}</v>
      <v n="11">Wisdom {is} good with an inheritance: and {by it there is} profit to them that see the sun. {good...: or, as good as an inheritance, yea, better too}</v>
      <v n="12">For wisdom {is} a defence, {and} money {is} a defence: but the excellency of knowledge {is, that} wisdom giveth life to them that have it. {defence: Heb. shadow}</v>
      <v n="13">Consider the work of God: for who can make {that} straight, which he hath made crooked?</v>
      <v n="14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. {set: Heb. made}</v>
      <v n="15">All {things} have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just {man} that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked {man} that prolongeth {his life} in his wickedness.</v>
      <v n="16">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? {destroy...: Heb. be desolate?}</v>
      <v n="17">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? {before...: Heb. not in thy time?}</v>
      <v n="18">{It is} good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</v>
      <v n="19">Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty {men} which are in the city.</v>
      <v n="20">For {there is} not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</v>
      <v n="21">Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: {take...: Heb. give not thine heart}</v>
      <v n="22">For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</v>
      <v n="23">All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it {was} far from me.</v>
      <v n="24">That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?</v>
      <v n="25">I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason {of things}, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness {and} madness: {I applied...: Heb. I and mine heart compassed}</v>
      <v n="26">And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart {is} snares and nets, {and} her hands {as} bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. {whoso...: Heb. he that is good before God}</v>
      <v n="27">Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, {counting} one by one, to find out the account: {counting...: or, weighing one thing after another, to find out the reason}</v>
      <v n="28">Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</v>
      <v n="29">Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</v>
