      <v n="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</v>
      <v n="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all {is} vanity.</v>
      <v n="3">What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</v>
      <v n="4">{One} generation passeth away, and {another} generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</v>
      <v n="5">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. {hasteth: Heb. panteth}</v>
      <v n="6">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</v>
      <v n="7">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea {is} not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. {return...: Heb. return to go}</v>
      <v n="8">All things {are} full of labour; man cannot utter {it}: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</v>
      <v n="9">The thing that hath been, it {is that} which shall be; and that which is done {is} that which shall be done: and {there is} no new {thing} under the sun.</v>
      <v n="10">Is there {any} thing whereof it may be said, See, this {is} new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</v>
      <v n="11">{There is} no remembrance of former {things}; neither shall there be {any} remembrance of {things} that are to come with {those} that shall come after.</v>
      <v n="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</v>
      <v n="13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all {things} that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. {to be...: or, to afflict them}</v>
      <v n="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all {is} vanity and vexation of spirit.</v>
      <v n="15">{That which is} crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. {that which is wanting: Heb. defect}</v>
      <v n="16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all {they} that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. {had...: Heb. had seen much}</v>
      <v n="17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</v>
      <v n="18">For in much wisdom {is} much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</v>
