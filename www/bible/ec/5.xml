      <v n="1">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</v>
      <v n="2">Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter {any} thing before God: for God {is} in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. {thing: or, word}</v>
      <v n="3">For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice {is known} by multitude of words.</v>
      <v n="4">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for {he hath} no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</v>
      <v n="5">Better {is it} that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</v>
      <v n="6">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it {was} an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</v>
      <v n="7">For in the multitude of dreams and many words {there are} also {divers} vanities: but fear thou God.</v>
      <v n="8">If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for {he that is} higher than the highest regardeth; and {there be} higher than they. {at the... Heb. at the will, or, purpose}</v>
      <v n="9">Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king {himself} is served by the field.</v>
      <v n="10">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this {is} also vanity.</v>
      <v n="11">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good {is there} to the owners thereof, saving the beholding {of them} with their eyes?</v>
      <v n="12">The sleep of a labouring man {is} sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</v>
      <v n="13">There is a sore evil {which} I have seen under the sun, {namely}, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.</v>
      <v n="14">But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and {there is} nothing in his hand.</v>
      <v n="15">As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</v>
      <v n="16">And this also {is} a sore evil, {that} in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?</v>
      <v n="17">All his days also he eateth in darkness, and {he hath} much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</v>
      <v n="18">Behold {that} which I have seen: {it is} good and comely {for one} to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it {is} his portion. {It is good...: Heb. there is a good which is comely, etc} {all the days: Heb. the number of the days}</v>
      <v n="19">Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this {is} the gift of God.</v>
      <v n="20">For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth {him} in the joy of his heart. {For...: or, Though he give not much, yet he remembereth, etc}</v>
