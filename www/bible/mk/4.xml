      <v n="1">And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</v>
      <v n="2">And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</v>
      <v n="3">Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</v>
      <v n="4">And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</v>
      <v n="5">And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</v>
      <v n="6">But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</v>
      <v n="7">And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</v>
      <v n="8">And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred.</v>
      <v n="9">And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</v>
      <v n="10">And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable.</v>
      <v n="11">And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all {these} things are done in parables:</v>
      <v n="12">That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and {their} sins should be forgiven them.</v>
      <v n="13">And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables?</v>
      <v n="14">The sower soweth the word.</v>
      <v n="15">And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.</v>
      <v n="16">And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</v>
      <v n="17">And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. {offended: or, stumbled, or, caused to fall into sin}</v>
      <v n="18">And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</v>
      <v n="19">And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. {lusts: or, inordinate desires}</v>
      <v n="20">And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive {it}, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</v>
      <v n="21">And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? {bushel: the word in the original signifieth a less measure}</v>
      <v n="22">For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</v>
      <v n="23">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</v>
      <v n="24">And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.</v>
      <v n="25">For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</v>
      <v n="26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</v>
      <v n="27">And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</v>
      <v n="28">For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</v>
      <v n="29">But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. {brought...: or, ripe}</v>
      <v n="30">And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</v>
      <v n="31">{It is} like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</v>
      <v n="32">But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</v>
      <v n="33">And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear {it}.</v>
      <v n="34">But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</v>
      <v n="35">And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</v>
      <v n="36">And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</v>
      <v n="37">And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</v>
      <v n="38">And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</v>
      <v n="39">And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</v>
      <v n="40">And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</v>
