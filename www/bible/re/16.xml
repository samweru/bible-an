      <v n="1">And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</v>
      <v n="2">And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and {upon} them which worshipped his image.</v>
      <v n="3">And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead {man}: and every living soul died in the sea.</v>
      <v n="4">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</v>
      <v n="5">And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</v>
      <v n="6">For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</v>
      <v n="7">And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous {are} thy judgments.</v>
      <v n="8">And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</v>
      <v n="9">And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. {scorched: or, burned}</v>
      <v n="10">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,</v>
      <v n="11">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</v>
      <v n="12">And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</v>
      <v n="13">And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs {come} out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</v>
      <v n="14">For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, {which} go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</v>
      <v n="15">Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed {is} he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</v>
      <v n="16">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</v>
      <v n="17">And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.</v>
      <v n="18">And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, {and} so great.</v>
      <v n="19">And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</v>
      <v n="20">And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</v>
      <v n="21">And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, {every stone} about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</v>
