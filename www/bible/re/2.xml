      <v n="1">Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</v>
      <v n="2">I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</v>
      <v n="3">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</v>
      <v n="4">Nevertheless I have {somewhat} against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</v>
      <v n="5">Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</v>
      <v n="6">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</v>
      <v n="7">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</v>
      <v n="8">And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</v>
      <v n="9">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and {I know} the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but {are} the synagogue of Satan.</v>
      <v n="10">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast {some} of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</v>
      <v n="11">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</v>
      <v n="12">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</v>
      <v n="13">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, {even} where Satan's seat {is}: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas {was} my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</v>
      <v n="14">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</v>
      <v n="15">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</v>
      <v n="16">Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</v>
      <v n="17">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth {it}.</v>
      <v n="18">And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet {are} like fine brass;</v>
      <v n="19">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last {to be} more than the first.</v>
      <v n="20">Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</v>
      <v n="21">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</v>
      <v n="22">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</v>
      <v n="23">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</v>
      <v n="24">But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</v>
      <v n="25">But that which ye have {already} hold fast till I come.</v>
      <v n="26">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</v>
      <v n="27">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</v>
      <v n="28">And I will give him the morning star.</v>
      <v n="29">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</v>
