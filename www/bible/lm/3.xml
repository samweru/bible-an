      <v n="1">I {am} the man {that} hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</v>
      <v n="2">He hath led me, and brought {me into} darkness, but not {into} light.</v>
      <v n="3">Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand {against me} all the day.</v>
      <v n="4">My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</v>
      <v n="5">He hath builded against me, and compassed {me} with gall and travail.</v>
      <v n="6">He hath set me in dark places, as {they that be} dead of old.</v>
      <v n="7">He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</v>
      <v n="8">Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</v>
      <v n="9">He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</v>
      <v n="10">He {was} unto me {as} a bear lying in wait, {and as} a lion in secret places.</v>
      <v n="11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.</v>
      <v n="12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</v>
      <v n="13">He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. {arrows: Heb. sons}</v>
      <v n="14">I was a derision to all my people; {and} their song all the day.</v>
      <v n="15">He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. {bitterness: Heb. bitternesses}</v>
      <v n="16">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. {covered...: or, rolled me in the ashes}</v>
      <v n="17">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. {prosperity: Heb. good}</v>
      <v n="18">And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</v>
      <v n="19">Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. {Remembering: or, Remember}</v>
      <v n="20">My soul hath {them} still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. {humbled: Heb. bowed}</v>
      <v n="21">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. {recall...: Heb. make to return to my heart}</v>
      <v n="22">{It is of} the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</v>
      <v n="23">{They are} new every morning: great {is} thy faithfulness.</v>
      <v n="24">The LORD {is} my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</v>
      <v n="25">The LORD {is} good unto them that wait for him, to the soul {that} seeketh him.</v>
      <v n="26">{It is} good that {a man} should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</v>
      <v n="27">{It is} good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</v>
      <v n="28">He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne {it} upon him.</v>
      <v n="29">He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</v>
      <v n="30">He giveth {his} cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.</v>
      <v n="31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever:</v>
      <v n="32">But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</v>
      <v n="33">For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. {willingly: Heb. from his heart}</v>
      <v n="34">To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</v>
      <v n="35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, {the most High: or, a superior}</v>
      <v n="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. {approveth not: or, seeth not}</v>
      <v n="37">Who {is} he {that} saith, and it cometh to pass, {when} the Lord commandeth {it} not?</v>
      <v n="38">Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?</v>
      <v n="39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? {complain: or, murmur}</v>
      <v n="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</v>
      <v n="41">Let us lift up our heart with {our} hands unto God in the heavens.</v>
      <v n="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</v>
      <v n="43">Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</v>
      <v n="44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that {our} prayer should not pass through.</v>
      <v n="45">Thou hast made us {as} the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.</v>
      <v n="46">All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</v>
      <v n="47">Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.</v>
      <v n="48">Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</v>
      <v n="49">Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</v>
      <v n="50">Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</v>
      <v n="51">Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. {mine heart: Heb. my soul} {because...: or, more than all}</v>
      <v n="52">Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</v>
      <v n="53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.</v>
      <v n="54">Waters flowed over mine head; {then} I said, I am cut off.</v>
      <v n="55">I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</v>
      <v n="56">Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</v>
      <v n="57">Thou drewest near in the day {that} I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.</v>
      <v n="58">O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</v>
      <v n="59">O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</v>
      <v n="60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance {and} all their imaginations against me.</v>
      <v n="61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, {and} all their imaginations against me;</v>
      <v n="62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</v>
      <v n="63">Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I {am} their musick.</v>
      <v n="64">Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</v>
      <v n="65">Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. {sorrow...: or, obstinacy of heart}</v>
      <v n="66">Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</v>
