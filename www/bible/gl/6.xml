      <v n="1">Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. {if: or, although}</v>
      <v n="2">Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</v>
      <v n="3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</v>
      <v n="4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</v>
      <v n="5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</v>
      <v n="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</v>
      <v n="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</v>
      <v n="8">For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</v>
      <v n="9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</v>
      <v n="10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all {men}, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</v>
      <v n="11">Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</v>
      <v n="12">As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</v>
      <v n="13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</v>
      <v n="14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. {by whom: or, whereby}</v>
      <v n="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</v>
      <v n="16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace {be} on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</v>
      <v n="17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</v>
      <v n="18">Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ {be} with your spirit. Amen. «{To the} Galatians written from Rome.»</v>
