      <v n="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</v>
      <v n="2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</v>
      <v n="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</v>
      <v n="4">Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</v>
      <v n="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</v>
      <v n="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</v>
      <v n="7">Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? {hinder you: or, drive you back}</v>
      <v n="8">This persuasion {cometh} not of him that calleth you.</v>
      <v n="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</v>
      <v n="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</v>
      <v n="11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.</v>
      <v n="12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</v>
      <v n="13">For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only {use} not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</v>
      <v n="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, {even} in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</v>
      <v n="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</v>
      <v n="16">{This} I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. {ye...: or, fulfil not}</v>
      <v n="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</v>
      <v n="18">But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</v>
      <v n="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are {these}; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</v>
      <v n="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</v>
      <v n="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told {you} in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</v>
      <v n="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</v>
      <v n="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</v>
      <v n="24">And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. {affections: or, passions}</v>
      <v n="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</v>
      <v n="26">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</v>
