      <v n="1">And Elijah the Tishbite, {who was} of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, {As} the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. {Elijah: Heb. Elijahu: Gr. Elias}</v>
      <v n="2">And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</v>
      <v n="3">Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.</v>
      <v n="4">And it shall be, {that} thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</v>
      <v n="5">So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan.</v>
      <v n="6">And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</v>
      <v n="7">And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. {after...: Heb. at the end of days}</v>
      <v n="8">And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</v>
      <v n="9">Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which {belongeth} to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. {Zarephath: Gr. Sarepta}</v>
      <v n="10">So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman {was} there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</v>
      <v n="11">And as she was going to fetch {it}, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</v>
      <v n="12">And she said, {As} the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I {am} gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</v>
      <v n="13">And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go {and} do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring {it} unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</v>
      <v n="14">For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day {that} the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. {sendeth: Heb. giveth}</v>
      <v n="15">And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days. {many...: or, a full year}</v>
      <v n="16">{And} the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. {by: Heb. by the hand of}</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass after these things, {that} the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</v>
      <v n="18">And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?</v>
      <v n="19">And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.</v>
      <v n="20">And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</v>
      <v n="21">And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. {stretched: Heb. measured} {into...: Heb. into his inward parts}</v>
      <v n="22">And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</v>
      <v n="23">And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</v>
      <v n="24">And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou {art} a man of God, {and} that the word of the LORD in thy mouth {is} truth.</v>
