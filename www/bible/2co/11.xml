      <v n="1">Would to God ye could bear with me a little in {my} folly: and indeed bear with me. {indeed bear...: or, indeed ye do bear with me}</v>
      <v n="2">For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present {you as} a chaste virgin to Christ.</v>
      <v n="3">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</v>
      <v n="4">For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or {if} ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with {him}. {with him: or, with me}</v>
      <v n="5">For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</v>
      <v n="6">But though {I be} rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</v>
      <v n="7">Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</v>
      <v n="8">I robbed other churches, taking wages {of them}, to do you service.</v>
      <v n="9">And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all {things} I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and {so} will I keep {myself}.</v>
      <v n="10">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. {no man...: Gr. this boasting shall not be stopped in me}</v>
      <v n="11">Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</v>
      <v n="12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</v>
      <v n="13">For such {are} false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</v>
      <v n="14">And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</v>
      <v n="15">Therefore {it is} no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</v>
      <v n="16">I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. {receive: or, suffer}</v>
      <v n="17">That which I speak, I speak {it} not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</v>
      <v n="18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</v>
      <v n="19">For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye {yourselves} are wise.</v>
      <v n="20">For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour {you}, if a man take {of you}, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.</v>
      <v n="21">I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</v>
      <v n="22">Are they Hebrews? so {am} I. Are they Israelites? so {am} I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so {am} I.</v>
      <v n="23">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I {am} more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.</v>
      <v n="24">Of the Jews five times received I forty {stripes} save one.</v>
      <v n="25">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</v>
      <v n="26">{In} journeyings often, {in} perils of waters, {in} perils of robbers, {in} perils by {mine own} countrymen, {in} perils by the heathen, {in} perils in the city, {in} perils in the wilderness, {in} perils in the sea, {in} perils among false brethren;</v>
      <v n="27">In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</v>
      <v n="28">Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.</v>
      <v n="29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</v>
      <v n="30">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.</v>
      <v n="31">The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.</v>
      <v n="32">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:</v>
      <v n="33">And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</v>
