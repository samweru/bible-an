      <v n="1">We then, {as} workers together {with him}, beseech {you} also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</v>
      <v n="2">(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now {is} the accepted time; behold, now {is} the day of salvation.)</v>
      <v n="3">Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</v>
      <v n="4">But in all {things} approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, {approving: Gr. commending}</v>
      <v n="5">In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; {in tumults: or, in tossings to and fro}</v>
      <v n="6">By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</v>
      <v n="7">By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</v>
      <v n="8">By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and {yet} true;</v>
      <v n="9">As unknown, and {yet} well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</v>
      <v n="10">As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and {yet} possessing all things.</v>
      <v n="11">O {ye} Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</v>
      <v n="12">Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</v>
      <v n="13">Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto {my} children,) be ye also enlarged.</v>
      <v n="14">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</v>
      <v n="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</v>
      <v n="16">And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in {them}; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</v>
      <v n="17">Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean {thing}; and I will receive you,</v>
      <v n="18">And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</v>
