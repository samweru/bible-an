      <v n="2">Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</v>
      <v n="3">Israel hath cast off {the thing that is} good: the enemy shall pursue him.</v>
      <v n="4">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew {it} not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</v>
      <v n="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast {thee} off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long {will it be} ere they attain to innocency?</v>
      <v n="6">For from Israel {was} it also: the workman made it; therefore it {is} not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</v>

      <v n="11">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</v>
      <v n="12">I have written to him the great things of my law, {but} they were counted as a strange thing.</v>
      <v n="13">They sacrifice flesh {for} the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat {it; but} the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. {They sacrifice...: or, In the sacrifices of mine offerings they, etc}</v>
      <v n="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</v>
