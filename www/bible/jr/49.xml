      <v n="1">Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why {then} doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities? {Concerning: or, Against} {their king: or, Melcom}</v>
      <v n="2">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="3">Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, {and} his priests and his princes together. {their king: or, Melcom}</v>
      <v n="4">Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, {saying}, Who shall come unto me? {thy...: or, thy valley floweth away}</v>
      <v n="5">Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</v>
      <v n="6">And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="7">Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; {Is} wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</v>
      <v n="8">Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time {that} I will visit him. {turn...: or, they are turned back}</v>
      <v n="9">If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave {some} gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. {till...: Heb. their sufficiency}</v>
      <v n="10">But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he {is} not.</v>
      <v n="11">Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve {them} alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</v>
      <v n="12">For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment {was} not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and {art} thou he {that} shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink {of it}.</v>
      <v n="13">For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</v>
      <v n="14">I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, {saying}, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</v>
      <v n="15">For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, {and} despised among men.</v>
      <v n="16">Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, {and} the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="17">Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</v>
      <v n="18">As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour {cities} thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.</v>
      <v n="19">Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who {is} a chosen {man, that} I may appoint over her? for who {is} like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who {is} that shepherd that will stand before me? {appoint me...: or, convent me in judgment?}</v>
      <v n="20">Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</v>
      <v n="21">The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. {Red sea: Heb. Weedy sea}</v>
      <v n="22">Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</v>
      <v n="23">Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; {there is} sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet. {fainthearted: Heb. melted} {on...: or, as on the sea}</v>
      <v n="24">Damascus is waxed feeble, {and} turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on {her}: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</v>
      <v n="25">How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</v>
      <v n="26">Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</v>
      <v n="27">And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</v>
      <v n="28">Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</v>
      <v n="29">Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear {is} on every side.</v>
      <v n="30">Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. {get...: Heb. flit greatly}</v>
      <v n="31">Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, {which} dwell alone. {wealthy: or, that is at ease}</v>
      <v n="32">And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them {that are} in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD. {in...: Heb. cut off into corners, or, that have the corners of their hair polled}</v>
      <v n="33">And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, {and} a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor {any} son of man dwell in it.</v>
      <v n="34">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</v>
      <v n="35">Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</v>
      <v n="36">And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</v>
      <v n="37">For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, {even} my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:</v>
      <v n="38">And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</v>
      <v n="39">But it shall come to pass in the latter days, {that} I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</v>
