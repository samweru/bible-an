      <v n="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and {with} a certain orator {named} Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</v>
      <v n="2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse {him}, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</v>
      <v n="3">We accept {it} always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</v>
      <v n="4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</v>
      <v n="5">For we have found this man {a} pestilent {fellow}, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</v>
      <v n="6">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</v>
      <v n="7">But the chief captain Lysias came {upon us}, and with great violence took {him} away out of our hands,</v>
      <v n="8">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</v>
      <v n="9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</v>
      <v n="10">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</v>
      <v n="11">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</v>
      <v n="12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</v>
      <v n="13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</v>
      <v n="14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</v>
      <v n="15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</v>
      <v n="16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and {toward} men.</v>
      <v n="17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</v>
      <v n="18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</v>
      <v n="19">Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</v>
      <v n="20">Or else let these same {here} say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</v>
      <v n="21">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</v>
      <v n="22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of {that} way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</v>
      <v n="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let {him} have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</v>
      <v n="24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</v>
      <v n="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</v>
      <v n="26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</v>
      <v n="27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</v>
