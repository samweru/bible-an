      <v n="1">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</v>
      <v n="2">I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</v>
      <v n="3">Especially {because I know} thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</v>
      <v n="4">My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</v>
      <v n="5">Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</v>
      <v n="6">And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</v>
      <v n="7">Unto which {promise} our twelve tribes, instantly serving {God} day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. {day and night: Gr. night and day}</v>
      <v n="8">Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</v>
      <v n="9">I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</v>
      <v n="10">Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against {them}.</v>
      <v n="11">And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled {them} to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted {them} even unto strange cities.</v>
      <v n="12">Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</v>
      <v n="13">At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.</v>
      <v n="14">And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? {it is} hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</v>
      <v n="15">And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</v>
      <v n="16">But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</v>
      <v n="17">Delivering thee from the people, and {from} the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</v>
      <v n="18">To open their eyes, {and} to turn {them} from darkness to light, and {from} the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</v>
      <v n="19">Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:</v>
      <v n="20">But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and {then} to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</v>
      <v n="21">For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill {me}.</v>
      <v n="22">Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</v>
      <v n="23">That Christ should suffer, {and} that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</v>
      <v n="24">And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</v>
      <v n="25">But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.</v>
      <v n="26">For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</v>
      <v n="27">King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.</v>
      <v n="28">Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.</v>
      <v n="29">And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</v>
      <v n="30">And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</v>
      <v n="31">And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</v>
      <v n="32">Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</v>
