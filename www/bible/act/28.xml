      <v n="1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</v>
      <v n="2">And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</v>
      <v n="3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid {them} on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</v>
      <v n="4">And when the barbarians saw the {venomous} beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</v>
      <v n="5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</v>
      <v n="6">Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</v>
      <v n="7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</v>
      <v n="8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</v>
      <v n="9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</v>
      <v n="10">Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded {us} with such things as were necessary.</v>
      <v n="11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</v>
      <v n="12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried {there} three days.</v>
      <v n="13">And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</v>
      <v n="14">Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</v>
      <v n="15">And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</v>
      <v n="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men {and} brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</v>
      <v n="18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let {me} go, because there was no cause of death in me.</v>
      <v n="19">But when the Jews spake against {it}, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</v>
      <v n="20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see {you}, and to speak with {you}: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</v>
      <v n="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</v>
      <v n="22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</v>
      <v n="23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into {his} lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and {out of} the prophets, from morning till evening.</v>
      <v n="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</v>
      <v n="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</v>
      <v n="26">Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</v>
      <v n="27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with {their} eyes, and hear with {their} ears, and understand with {their} heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</v>
      <v n="28">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and {that} they will hear it.</v>
      <v n="29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</v>
      <v n="30">And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</v>
      <v n="31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</v>
