      <v n="1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</v>
      <v n="2">And devout men carried Stephen {to his burial}, and made great lamentation over him.</v>
      <v n="3">As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed {them} to prison.</v>
      <v n="4">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</v>
      <v n="5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</v>
      <v n="6">And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</v>
      <v n="7">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed {with them}: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</v>
      <v n="8">And there was great joy in that city.</v>
      <v n="9">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</v>
      <v n="10">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</v>
      <v n="11">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</v>
      <v n="12">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</v>
      <v n="13">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. {miracles...: Gr. signs and great miracles}</v>
      <v n="14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</v>
      <v n="15">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</v>
      <v n="16">(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</v>
      <v n="17">Then laid they {their} hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</v>
      <v n="18">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</v>
      <v n="19">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</v>
      <v n="20">But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</v>
      <v n="21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</v>
      <v n="22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</v>
      <v n="23">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and {in} the bond of iniquity.</v>
      <v n="24">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</v>
      <v n="25">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</v>
      <v n="26">And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</v>
      <v n="27">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</v>
      <v n="28">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</v>
      <v n="29">Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</v>
      <v n="30">And Philip ran thither to {him}, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</v>
      <v n="31">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</v>
      <v n="32">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</v>
      <v n="33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</v>
      <v n="34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</v>
      <v n="35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</v>
      <v n="36">And as they went on {their} way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, {here is} water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</v>
      <v n="37">And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</v>
      <v n="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</v>
      <v n="39">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</v>
      <v n="40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</v>
